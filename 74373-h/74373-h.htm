<small>THE GIANT SORCERER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span> and <span class="smcap">Cassandra</span> lived with their Aunt
Mary in a white house which was tucked away
from the road in a group of five elm trees. Behind
the house was a white barn with a green door,
and beside the barn to the west lay the orchard
enclosed by a gray stone wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Often Raphael would lean out of the nursery window
and wonder what lay beyond the wooded hill
that sheltered the little farm from the north wind.
There must be, he thought, great cities and seas
and mountains. And animals like the tigers and
giraffes which chased each other round his bedroom
wall paper. Some day he would take Cassie
and run away and visit these places. They
would see the whole world for themselves.</p>

<p>One night when Raphael went to bed, he did
not fall asleep. Instead he lay and watched the
moonlight on the window sill. Across the room
he could see the white outline of Cassandra’s bed,
and Cassie a motionless white mound asleep in it.
To-morrow, he thought, sleepily, I must build a
house for the robins. Habakkuk needs a bath
and a new collar. Why do dogs hate baths?
Why do I hate to have my face washed? Everything
Aunt Mary called good was hateful.</p>

<p>A railroad engine hooted for the crossing a
mile beyond the barn. Raphael heard the roar and
rattle of the cars as they pounded over the tracks
which curved through the valley like sleeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
snakes. Trains were fast and powerful. He
loved to watch them race to and from Uniontown.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Cassandra
stirred in bed, pushing aside the blankets. Raphael
watched her rise and walk to the open window.
He was about to whisper to her, when she
climbed over the sill onto the little porch which
jutted out over the back door. Raphael immediately
jumped from his bed and crossed to the
window.</p>

<p>While he looked out, his sister climbed down the
trellis that edged the porch and walked like a little
white ghost past the barn and into the orchard
that lay along the slope of the hill. Raphael followed
quietly. Aunt Mary would be very angry if
she knew they were out of bed.</p>

<p>Everything was moist and silver in the moonlight.
The grass bent under Raphael’s feet as he
hurried through the orchard and over the stone
wall that rimmed the woods. By the time he had
crossed the rough wall and felt the little sticks of
the wood path under his bare feet, Cassandra had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
disappeared. Raphael hitched up his purple pajamas
and ran.</p>

<p>He had taken only a few steps when to his
amazement he heard the sound of voices. He
stopped short, listened a moment, and then crept
forward. He saw his sister standing before a tall
figure which blocked the wood path. Raphael
could not see the stranger’s face, but he heard
him say:</p>

<p>‘If you will come with me, Cassandra, I will
take you to a city full of strange toys. You shall
have dolls to play with, dolls that walk and talk;
and houses for them to live in with running water
and elevators and electric lights. You shall have
a little automobile, and a great store full of toys
all to yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ whispered Cassandra.</p>

<p>‘Will you come with me?’ went on the stranger.
‘You needn’t be afraid. I won’t harm you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ repeated Cassandra. Her voice was husky
with sleep.</p>

<p>‘Come, then,’ commanded the stranger and held
out his arms. ‘I order it. You cannot disobey.’</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_004_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">‘I AM MECHANUS, THE GIANT SORCERER’</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>Raphael, who had crept close in order to hear
more clearly what the stranger said, sprang forward.</p>

<p>‘Cassie! Cassie!’ he cried. ‘Wait! Wait!’</p>

<p>The stranger took Cassandra in his round arms.
‘Boy,’ he ordered, ‘go home to bed.’</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ demanded Raphael.</p>

<p>‘I am Mechanus, the Giant Sorcerer,’ answered
the stranger proudly.</p>

<p>Raphael looked at him fearfully. In the moonlight
he appeared black and very terrible holding
Cassandra so easily. He was taller than any
man the boy had ever seen, and his eyes shone
like pale electric lights. He was dressed in some
light material that merged into the dark shadows.</p>

<p>‘Are you a man?’ whispered Raphael, awed.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said the Sorcerer conversationally. ‘I am
a mechanical wonder invented by man to be
greater than all men.’</p>

<p>‘What do you want with Cassandra?’ asked
Raphael, taking heart.</p>

<p>‘My boy,’ exclaimed Mechanus, ‘that happens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
to be my affair. She will go home with me because
I want her to.’</p>

<p>She would go home with him, Cassandra, his
sister, and he would never see her any more. A
mechanical wonder greater than all men blocked
the path.</p>

<p>‘You shan’t take Cassie away! I don’t care if
you are a sorcerer!’ screamed Raphael desperately
and dashed at the stranger.</p>

<p>Cold fingers like steel hooks lifted him to one
side, and a metallic voice rang in his ears, ‘Be
quiet, young fool!’</p>

<p>Raphael felt himself falling slowly into space.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>GÆA, THE EARTH MOTHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Raphael woke, he was lying alone in the
moonlight. Cassandra and the stranger had disappeared.
The woods were very still. His head
ached. Slowly the boy got to his feet and stumbled
along the path which led to a small clearing
at the top of the hill. Here he sat down on a large
stone. Cassie was stolen!</p>

<p>Raphael was about to turn and run home when
he heard the whistle of wings, and looking up
saw a huge bird sail over the black tree-tops and
light on the ground before him. Raphael was so
astonished he could not move. He sat and stared
in numb amazement.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said the bird sharply, as he peered at
him out of one yellow eye.</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ asked Raphael faintly.</p>

<p>‘I am Empyrean, Chief of All the Eagles in the
Sky, General of All the Armies of the Air.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ gasped Raphael. Then, because he felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
powerless and lonely, he sniffled, ‘Cassie has been
stolen. A sorcerer came and took her away.’</p>

<p>‘Stop crying!’ ordered the eagle fiercely.</p>

<p>Raphael dried his tears on an arm of his pajamas.</p>

<p>‘Tell me what happened,’ demanded the eagle.</p>

<p>‘Mechanus, the Giant Sorcerer, stole Cassie.’</p>

<p>‘Which way did they go?’ asked the eagle.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. The Sorcerer knocked me
down.’</p>

<p>The eagle said nothing for a moment, but
stared straight at Raphael until he felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>‘We shall find them. Come with me,’ the eagle
commanded.</p>

<p>‘But how can I go?’ asked the boy.</p>

<p>‘I shall take you. Climb on my back. Hurry,’
ordered the bird when he saw that Raphael hesitated.
‘I won’t hurt you.’</p>

<p>He looked so fierce with his hooked yellow bill
and curved talons that Raphael did not dare to
disobey. He crawled clumsily astride the eagle’s
neck and settled back between his great wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>‘Are you ready?’ asked the bird.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Raphael breathlessly.</p>

<p>The eagle raised his wings and leapt into
space. There was a slight shock as though they
had jumped into a nest of down, and then with
increasing speed the eagle forced his way higher
and higher. Raphael could feel each upward surge
as the wings rose and fell. The wind whistled in
his ears a thin song.</p>

<p>Raphael thought of Cassandra and then of Aunt
Mary. Would she cry when she learned that he
and his sister had gone away? Would she blame
him for letting the Giant Sorcerer steal Cassandra?
He choked back the lump rising in his
throat.</p>

<p>Suddenly he noticed that it was quite light,
that it was morning. He looked ahead and saw
the sun rising over a great mountain that stretched
across the horizon. The night shadows were
gathered like a curtain from a painting. When
Raphael looked below, he could see great rolling
forests laced by silver rivers. The eagle flew
rapidly on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Steadily they drew near the mountain, and
Raphael noticed that they were rising higher and
higher. Other great birds, eagles the boy supposed,
swept down from the air and joined them,
sailing round in great circles with fierce cries of
welcome. It was cold flying so high in the air.
Raphael shivered and leant back against the warm
feathers of Empyrean.</p>

<p>They lit on the peak of the mountain just as
the sun crowned the summit with light. One by
one the other eagles swooped down and joined
them on the bare rock.</p>

<p>Chief of All the Eagles turned to them and
demanded, ‘Have you any news?’</p>

<p>‘We have news!’ screamed the eagles.</p>

<p>‘Quickly, then, let us make this boy one of
us, in the name of Gæa!’ At this all the eagles
raised their wings and bowed their heads reverently.</p>

<p>‘Are—are we going to save Cassie?’ asked
Raphael nervously.</p>

<p>‘With the aid of Gæa she shall be saved,’ answered
Chief of All the Eagles in the Sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>‘Who is Gæa? Did she send you to help me?
How did she know Cassie had been stolen?’</p>

<p>‘My son,’ said Empyrean sternly, ‘Gæa is the
Earth Mother who knows all things. You shall
learn more later.’</p>

<p>For a moment the eagle stared into the rising
sun. Then, turning to Raphael, who did not dare
to question further, he ordered him to take off his
clothes. When Raphael stood naked upon the
rock, the eagles solemnly bowed their heads as
though in prayer. After which they presented
Raphael with a magnificent suit of black feathers
which buttoned up the front with clasps of luminous
stone.</p>

<p>When Raphael had put on his new clothes,
Chief of All the Eagles in the Sky spoke:</p>

<p>‘Comrades, I had a dream. And in my dream
Gæa, the Earth Mother, the All-Powerful, appeared
to me and told me of the Giant Sorcerer
and of the great war between all nature and mechanics
that is to be. Then She said, “A child
shall save you, if it is written that you will be
saved. Bless him with my power over land and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
sky and sea.” The dream changed and I saw a boy
alone upon a hillside. I woke. And we are here!’</p>

<p>The eagles stirred uneasily, but said nothing.
Empyrean continued, turning to Raphael, ‘In the
name of Gæa I confer on you power over the
Earth, the Air, and the Sea. Through Her you
may command nature, the wind, the thunder, the
lightning, the earthquake, and the volcano.</p>

<p>‘Already we have called upon all the people to
help us, the animals, the birds, the fish, and the
reptiles. In this way we shall crush the Giant
Sorcerer, who is our enemy.’</p>

<p>The eagle, whose voice had grown louder and
louder, strutted fiercely up and down. When he
finished, all the eagles screamed together, and
struck their breasts, and raised their wings.
Anger flashed from their yellow eyes.</p>

<p>Then as at a signal they rose from the mountain
on which they stood and flew in a circle
above it. Faster and faster they flew, their wings
sounding the thunder of flight.</p>

<p>‘Climb on my back quickly,’ commanded Chief
of All the Eagles in the Sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>When Raphael was seated, Empyrean darted
into the air, and led his warriors up and up until
the boy felt dizzy in the cold light air.</p>

<p>‘Behold!’ screamed the eagle suddenly.</p>

<p>Raphael looked down. Beyond the mountain
lay the blue-white sea shimmering in the sunlight.
Far below he noticed a black speck outlined
against the ocean. It looked in the distance
like a dragonfly. All the eagles cried out fiercely
and beat their wings.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter? What’s that?’ Raphael
yelled, leaning along the eagle’s neck. ‘Is it an
aeroplane?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ screamed the eagle.</p>

<p>‘Is it the Giant Sorcerer?’ gasped Raphael.</p>

<p>Chief of All the Eagles did not answer, but
folding his wings dropped like a meteor toward
the earth. Behind them swept the others like
falling stars.</p>

<small>THE CASTLE OF THE SORCERER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> fell earthward until Raphael felt dizzy and
sick. His ears hummed; his stomach rose. He
shut his eyes and clutched desperately at the
feathers along the eagle’s back. After an agony
of excitement, the wind-song died to a hum; they
dropped less rapidly, and Raphael with a gulp
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>They were flying above the sea, which appeared
in the morning light to be covered by a
bright sheet of silver mail. The aeroplane of the
Sorcerer had disappeared.</p>

<p>The eagles bore Raphael swiftly toward a
cloud which lay in the distance above the ocean.
As they drew near, the cloud changed, and land
appeared rising fresh and green out of the sea.
On this land the boy made out a great palace of
white marble.</p>

<p>‘Is this the Sorcerer’s castle?’ Raphael shouted
into his friend’s ear.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_014_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">‘IS THIS THE SORCERER’S CASTLE?’ RAPHAEL SHOUTED</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Empyrean nodded.</p>

<p>First the eagles flew round the castle from
left to right, and Raphael marveled that there
were no doors, no windows in this strange building.
All he saw were blind walls which towered
heavenward, a huge pillar of cream-white stone.</p>

<p>When the eagles had circled the building three
times, they flew directly across the top. On the
roof was an immense court surrounded by walls
and shaped like the inside of a saucer. Within
this bowl lay the aeroplane of the Sorcerer. Raphael
saw figures running about on the roof.</p>

<p>Beside the large island lay a little one, barren
and brown like the naked back of a sea monster.
Here the eagles gathered together for a council
of war. After many impatient and fierce proposals
from his followers, Chief of All the Eagles in the
Sky spoke:</p>

<p>‘We have come, O Eagles, to save the sister
of our friend and to war against our enemy, the
Sorcerer. But harken. We pit our strength and
cunning against a powerful foe who has magic at
his command about which we know little. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
brother,’—the eagle motioned toward Raphael—‘is
of another people, a people more accustomed
than we to such machines as this Sorcerer is lord
over. Therefore it seems advisable to me that he
go forth and bring us news.’</p>

<p>The eagle ceased to speak. The bird-warriors
turned and stared at the boy, who, proud and
self-conscious, bowed his head in assent. His first
test had come.</p>

<p>Calling upon Gæa, as Empyrean had instructed
him, Raphael claimed the powers of a water
spider, and turned toward the water that separated
the little island from the larger one. He was
to try the powers granted him by the Queen
Mother. Would the sea hold him? He stepped
nervously onto a wave that broke in a carpet of
white foam at his feet, and took a hasty step forward,
then another. It was partly like walking
over an uneven floor, partly like climbing a moving
sandhill.</p>

<p>Far below on the bottom of the ocean he could
hear clams chanting a hymn of triumph in which
he distinctly caught the echo of his own name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>In a few moments Raphael stood on the shore
of the main island underneath the walls of the
Sorcerer’s castle. The tall blocks of stone which
seemed to pierce the reeling sky were cold to his
touch. There was no life, no movement on the
whole island. Even the palms which fringed the
shore were motionless. Only a large steel sign
that read, <i>Keep Out! This Means You!</i> hinted
at human occupation. To the castle itself he could
find neither door nor window. That’s very queer,
thought the boy.</p>

<p>Calling upon Gæa for the powers of a bird,
Raphael raised his hands above his head and
stood upon his toes. Then, using his arms as
wings, he jumped upward. It was like beating a
very soft feather pillow. Slowly the boy left the
ground, kicking awkwardly with his legs; and
lit, out of breath and sprawling, in the saucer-like
basin where he had last seen the aeroplane of the
Sorcerer. The roof was deserted and bleak. Only
the thin outline of a large trapdoor showed where
the Sorcerer had entered his stronghold.</p>

<p>Raphael walked about nervously, expecting to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
be attacked at any moment. He could see no sign
of life, and yet he felt that invisible eyes watched
him.</p>

<p>There must be, he thought, another door to
this castle under the sea.</p>

<p>Raphael leapt from the roof to fly back to the
eagles. He dropped earthward, and only by
beating the air wildly with his outstretched arms
could he regain his balance. With a sense of relief
he landed fluttering like a wounded bird on
the little island.</p>

<p>When he told the eagles what he had found,
they burst into a shrill clamor devising schemes
of war. As before, Chief of All the Eagles in the
Sky was the last to speak:</p>

<p>‘Comrades, since you demand war, there shall
be war. But I believe you underestimate the
power and resource of the enemy. Before we use
violence, let us discover whether there is another
entrance to this castle through which the Sorcerer
might escape. Although a journey below
the sea is not possible for eagles, to Raphael, who
has power over the sea, it should not be difficult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>‘My boy’—he turned to Raphael—‘I charge
you with this mission. Go to the King or President
of the Atlantic, for I think that he will help us.’</p>

<p>In this way the conference ended.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>DOWN TO THE SEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Calling</span> upon the power of a dolphin, Raphael
walked down into the sea. When the green water
closed over his head, he realized that he had entered
a new world, as strange as the earth which
he had left. He took a breath cautiously and
found that he could breathe. I wonder, he
thought, whether the fish know that there is another
world on top of the water, and that there
are other worlds even beyond that.</p>

<p>Raphael climbed slowly down a great cinder
cliff to which clung odd mosses and seaweed.
He was looking for some sign of life in the silent
depths when he stumbled carelessly over a rock
and started to fall. It was then he noticed for the
first time the peculiar nature of the land he was in.
Instead of falling, he tipped forward and settled
gently through the water face down. Why,
thought Raphael, this is like flying. And he swam
a few strokes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>At the bottom of the cliff, he sat down to rest
in a large bush of seaweed which floated soft
green branches toward him. He was out of
breath.</p>

<p>‘Be careful,’ said a voice at his elbow as he
was about to settle back comfortably. ‘There is
a sea urchin almost underneath you.’</p>

<p>Raphael struggled to his feet as fast as he
could. He saw no living thing, however, until he
looked up. Above him finned a large pop-eyed
fish which stared down at him coldly.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Raphael, ‘I didn’t expect to see you
there.’</p>

<p>‘Didn’t you?’ asked the fish sarcastically.</p>

<p>Raphael flushed, but replied politely. ‘May I
ask, Sir or Madam, what a sea urchin is?’</p>

<p>The fish eyed him angrily. ‘My name is Mary
Cod.’</p>

<p>And she pointed to a little round creature like
a black pincushion with long spines.</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon,’ answered Raphael humbly.
‘I suppose I should have recognized you.’</p>

<p>‘You could not be expected to know me,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
sneered the cod in a temper. ‘We look quite
different on a dinner-table.’</p>

<p>Raphael was shocked at this. He thought it a
joke in rather poor taste.</p>

<p>‘Miss Cod,’ he began, ‘I am sorry to have....’</p>

<p>‘Miss Cod, indeed!’ mouthed the codfish.
‘Tommy, Walter, Archibald, Augustus, Percy,
Angela, Peter, William, and Mary, come here
this minute.’</p>

<p>And Mrs. Cod sailed off, wriggling her fins indignantly,
followed by her family, which dawdled
indolently behind, opening and shutting their
mouths.</p>

<p>I wonder if they all belong to her, thought
Raphael. They look more like a school of fish
on a lecture tour or an outing.</p>

<p>He was regretting that he had not asked her
more about life under the sea, and where he might
find the King or the President of the ocean, when
a small voice fluted in his ear:</p>

<p>‘Do I understand, young man, that you would
like to see the President?’</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_022_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_022_facing.jpg" alt="‘MISS COD, INDEED!’ MOUTHED THE CODFISH">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">‘MISS COD, INDEED!’ MOUTHED THE CODFISH</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Again Raphael, startled, looked helplessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
about. He was not yet accustomed to the semi-twilight
of the ocean. All he saw were the rocks
down which he had tumbled, and the lacy branches
of the seaweed which pulsed slowly back and
forth with the ocean current. He looked up, but
could see nothing except long rays of green light
which filtered in broad bands through the water.</p>

<p>‘Do I understand, young man, that you would
like to see the President?’ repeated the voice
patiently.</p>

<p>Then Raphael discovered a sea horse hovering
like a humming bird so close to his ear that
he had to turn his head to see him. He balanced
upright like a ribbed celluloid toy, and held a
branch of green weed in his tail.</p>

<p>‘I want to see the President very much,’ answered
Raphael hastily.</p>

<p>‘Follow me,’ said the sea horse. ‘I have the
honor of being Equerry to the President.’ He
started to swim away.</p>

<p>Raphael rose heavily, and, moving his arms in
a swimming motion, followed his guide as rapidly
as he could. They went up a steep ridge and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
came to a plateau covered with sea grass which
moved with the ocean current like a field of wheat
in the wind. As they hurried along, Raphael saw
black shadows drift slowly back and forth, nosing
the grass.</p>

<p>‘What are those, Mr. Sea Horse?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘They are sharks, Mr. Raphael.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Raphael nervously, and looked about
for a bush to hide in. The sea horse noticed
this.</p>

<p>‘They won’t hurt you,’ he said, waiting for
Raphael to catch up. ‘They are far too lazy.’</p>

<p>Raphael and the sea horse swam forward
side by side. Now that he was more used to this
strange method of walking, he found that he
could travel quite easily.</p>

<p>‘I met Mrs. Cod,’ he said by way of conversation.</p>

<p>The sea horse laughed without changing his
expression. ‘I suppose she was as cross as usual.
She has come south for the winter and has been
complaining of the heat and her family ever since.
She belongs farther north, and not in these semi-tropical
waters at all,’ the sea horse went on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
explain, ‘and her family is really quite a trial. Of
course they aren’t all hers. Most fish don’t ever
see their children.’</p>

<p>While they were talking, Raphael and the sea
horse crossed the plateau and started to descend.
The way became rough, and gigantic, moss-covered
boulders blocked the path. The seaweed
grew thicker, tangling into a rich brown and
green jungle of limp branches through which
Raphael found it increasingly difficult to force his
way. Great lava mountains towered above them
in ropy hills and cliffs, or overhung black pits
which the rays of the sun could not pierce.</p>

<p>‘Where does the President live?’ asked
Raphael after a long silence.</p>

<p>‘Not far from here. I suppose you know that
they are all expecting you.’</p>

<p>‘Who is expecting me?’</p>

<p>‘His Excellency, the Cabinet, and the Admirals
of the North and South Atlantic.’</p>

<p>‘Really?’ said Raphael, who had ceased to be
surprised at anything. ‘Who told them I was
coming?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>‘Gæa, the Queen Mother, sent us word,’ answered
the sea horse as he dipped his body respectfully.</p>

<p>He seemed disinclined to say more and Raphael
politely changed the subject.</p>

<p>‘Would you mind telling me your President’s
name?’</p>

<p>‘Willingly,’ answered the sea horse. ‘The
President of the Atlantic democracy is His Excellency,
Mr. Albert Right Whale. He was elected, as
you may have heard, on account of his size.’</p>

<p>‘Is the Pacific a democracy also?’ asked
Raphael.</p>

<p>‘Oh, dear, no,’ replied the sea horse proudly.</p>

<p>Just then the path they were following joined
a broad highway of white sand which ran between
two high mountains. Along this road swam
thousands of fish, more fish than Raphael had
ever seen. For the most part they drifted along
in schools: gray snappers, muttonfish, and red
and black groupers. Occasionally Raphael and
his guide passed a sting ray asleep like a mottled
fungus on the ocean floor. And once they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
came upon an immense octopus shambling along
on his knuckles.</p>

<p>The road gradually narrowed to a gateway between
two walls of black obsidian. Most of the
fish made no effort to pass this barrier, but swam
slowly in a circle about the entrance. Many of
them turned away and drifted silently back the
way they had come like ghosts.</p>

<p>‘Here we are,’ said the sea horse. ‘Follow
me.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span> and the sea horse swam through the
gateway, which was guarded by two gray octopi,
and entered a huge amphitheater. On all sides
rose black hills covered with brown ooze. The
floor was coral, whose pink-and-white branches
were laced into miniature caves and grottoes in
which lived strange crabs and small beautifully
tinted fish. Clinging to the coral, brown sea fans
waved in the pulse of the ocean, while here and
there sea anemones bloomed like giant white
chrysanthemums. Through this garden swam
silver moonfish, striped black-and-white angel
fish, and the spotted red and green rockhind.</p>

<p>After a quick glance Raphael paid them little
attention as he moved across the uneven floor.
Instead he stared at the indistinct forms which
circled like shadows in the center of the immense
arena. He had never seen such gigantic creatures.</p>

<p>‘Come with me,’ said the sea horse, and piloted
him toward a magnificent black whale who swam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
sedately about in the center of a group of admirers.
Cabinet ministers, Admiralty, and Senators,
thought Raphael. When they were quite close,
the sea horse stopped.</p>

<p>‘Mr. President,’ he announced in his thin
small voice, ‘may I introduce Mr. Raphael, Commander
of the Elements, and General of All the
Armies Above and Below the Sea, Emissary
Extraordinary of Gæa, the Earth Mother.’</p>

<p>The sea horse paused and asked Raphael in
an aside whether he had any more titles. ‘For,’
he said, ‘they are very fond of titles in this
democracy.’</p>

<p>The President smiled heavily, dropping his
huge lower jaw and exposing the whalebone
strainers in his mouth.</p>

<p>‘Pleased to meet you, Mr. Raphael. We have
had word about you.’ And he held out an immense
fluke toward the boy. Raphael’s hand
seemed ridiculously small, but he grasped the outer
edge of the rough, oily flipper manfully.</p>

<p>‘Martha,’ called the President to a slightly
smaller black whale, ‘meet Mr. Raphael.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>At this the First Lady of the Ocean bustled
up, quivering with anxiety to please. ‘Glad to
meet any friend of my husband’s,’ she gurgled.
‘You’re a real stranger round these parts.’</p>

<p>Raphael bowed. ‘Mr. President,’ he said,
‘might I have a word with you in private, if Mrs.
Whale will excuse us?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ said the President. ‘My dear, will
you pardon us?’ Again they bowed to one another.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Whale and the sea horse had
withdrawn, Raphael turned to the President.
‘Mr. President,’ he said very fast and without
drawing breath, ‘I have come to ask a favor of
you as the Leading Citizen of the Ocean.’ His
Excellency smiled, flattered.</p>

<p>Then Raphael told him about Cassandra, the
Sorcerer, and the blind castle on the island. ‘I
have come,’ he concluded, ‘to find a door to the
castle and to ask your help.’</p>

<p>‘Since you come from Gæa, the Queen Mother,’
replied the President in his best official manner,
speaking very carefully, ‘you are more than welcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
to the Sea. But here we are ignorant of the
Earth, and such people as this Giant Sorcerer.</p>

<p>‘Besides this you are a man, and man has done
us few favors. Instead he has destroyed many
of our noblest sea families. For this reason our
hearts are hard.’</p>

<p>‘But Mr. President,’ interrupted Raphael excitedly,
‘I don’t want very much help. All I
need is a guard placed about the castle rock in
case the Sorcerer should escape.’</p>

<p>The President was impressed. ‘Well, well,’ he
muttered, ‘what you ask is little. And if we don’t
love man, we should probably love a sorcerer
even less.’ He sighed. ‘I don’t mean to be discourteous,
but political life is full of difficult decisions,
and times are not as easy as they used to
be. What is more, we have our own wars to fight
in the ocean, for most of us feed by war. However,
I’ll help you now, if you will help us in the
future.’</p>

<p>At this point Mrs. Whale burst in upon the
conversation.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Albert,’ she cried, bumping him coyly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
‘you men are always talking business. You’ll
forgive my interrupting, won’t you, Mr. Raphael?
I’m sure Albert will scold me later. But I do
want you to see our son before you leave. Children
of the Sea so seldom have a chance to see
the strange people who come from the Land.
Especially live ones. They tell me that we were
land folk at one time. My husband says that if
this were known it would do him no end of harm
politically.’</p>

<p>‘Now, now, little woman,’ interrupted her husband
kindly, ‘run along. We have serious business
to attend to.’</p>

<p>The President turned and beckoned with his
fluke to the sea horse.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Equerry,’ he commanded, ‘summon the
Grand Council.’</p>

<p>At a word from the sea horse, the Grand
Council, which was made up of the House of Representatives
as well as the Admiralty, gathered
and stationed itself in a semi-circle about the
President, the big fish nearest the ocean floor, the
little fish above them like spectators in a vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
theater audience. Raphael saw a porpoise, a manatee,
a sawfish, a swordfish, a spearfish, a sailfish,
a tarpon, a tuna, several kinds of sharks, besides
a dolphin, a turtle, and numerous representative
sea creatures he could not name.</p>

<p>When they were all in their places, the President
introduced Raphael, who repeated his adventures
with the Giant Sorcerer and urged them to
aid him.</p>

<p>‘For,’ he said, ‘if my search for an entrance
to the castle fails, in the name of Gæa I shall tear
apart the ocean floor and bury the Sorcerer beneath
the sea which otherwise he would surely
dare to make his own.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ echoed the multitude, who stared at him
out of round unlidded eyes. Raphael was about
to continue his speech about the rescue of Cassandra,
which secretly he thought very fine indeed,
when swarms of little fish suddenly flashed
through the assembly and darted into the green
weeds that skirted the base of the surrounding
cliffs. Several of the larger fish stirred hungrily,
while the President looked annoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>‘Mr. Equerry,’ he demanded ponderously,
‘what is the meaning of this interruption?’</p>

<p>‘I shall try to find out, Your Excellency,’ answered
the sea horse as he was tossed on the
wave of the President’s double-chinned displeasure.
But even as he spoke more fish
streamed through the gateway to the great chamber,
and swept the council amphitheater. Then
shadows appeared struggling at the entrance, and
fine sand clouded the water. No one said a word,
but fear spread through the water in mysterious
waves.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the shadows between the cliffs,
Raphael saw a strange form appear, a creature
with massive legs and arms, in whose round head
gleamed two goggle eyes. This thing advanced
slowly and, bending over, picked up a black cable
from the ocean floor.</p>

<p>When the monster saw the gathering, it stopped
and peered stupidly about, balancing on one squat,
steel-ribbed foot. Then with slow strides it drifted
back the way it had come.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Equerry,’ shouted the President in a shrill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
voice, ‘summon the Admirals of the North and
South Atlantic. Instruct Rear Admiral Swordfish
and Rear Admiral Sawfish to pursue the enemy
and drive him from the sea. In the meantime,
the meeting is adjourned.’ He turned nervously to
Raphael. ‘I need a good blow of fresh air. I feel
as though I had been down at least five hours.’</p>

<p>He lifted his immense head toward the surface,
and without another word rose like a black cloud.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>OFF TO WAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span> followed the President as quickly as he
could to the top of the ocean. The afternoon sun
was descending when he lifted his head above
water. Far away to the west he thought he could
see the castle of the Sorcerer, but it was difficult
to be sure with the sun shining in his eyes. He
swam slowly toward the President, who was
spouting feathery plumes of vapor as he circled
about.</p>

<p>‘Goodness, that creature gave me a start,’ said
the President when Raphael paddled up. And he
blew a jet of vapor over the boy.</p>

<p>‘My nerves are not what they used to be,’ he
confided. ‘It comes from being hunted. Anything
that looks like a man makes me jump, with exceptions,
of course. What did you make of it?’</p>

<p>‘It was a diver, I think,’ answered Raphael
importantly. ‘A diver looks very terrible,’ he
added, to save the President’s feelings. ‘I’ve often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
seen them in the movies at home when Aunt
Mary let us go.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ sighed the President, ‘if it’s only
a diver. I thought that....’</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Whale appeared blowing nervously,
followed by an ugly, freckled, snub-nosed
little whale some twenty feet in length.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Albert,’ she wailed, ‘what was it? Do
you think there is any danger? I can’t bear the
suspense. I don’t care for myself, but Junior will
be frightened out of yards of growth.’</p>

<p>‘It was nothing, dear. Only a diver,’ replied
her husband. ‘I don’t believe there is any danger.’</p>

<p>At this Junior playfully butted his mother.</p>

<p>‘Junior, don’t! Do you want to hurt your
mother, who would give every fluke in her body
for you?’</p>

<p>Then she saw Raphael. ‘Why, Mr. Raphael!
How nice to see you up here! Junior’s such a
bad boy,’ she apologized proudly. ‘He’s getting
his strainers. Don’t you think he looks like the
President? Stop it, Junior! Do you want me to
slap you? There, shake a fluke with Mr. Raphael.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Mr. Raphael comes from the Land, where they
say we once lived. What is the world coming
to!’</p>

<p>Junior said nothing, but bumped his mother
again as if by accident.</p>

<p>‘Now, Junior, do stop!’ she exclaimed almost
tearfully. ‘Where are your manners? Children
are so difficult! I always try to reason with my
little ones, but sometimes it seems as though
Junior just won’t listen. My husband always
laughs at me, but he spoils Junior just as badly
as I do. What do you think, Mr. Raphael?’</p>

<p>Raphael did not have time to say what he
thought, for just then a small voice fluted, ‘Mr.
President, the Navy has formed in review.’ It
was the sea horse.</p>

<p>‘I have enjoyed my blow,’ said the President
more calmly. ‘And now I must leave you two to
chat.’</p>

<p>‘Your Excellency,’ begged Raphael, ‘I want
to know what happens. May I go down with
you?’</p>

<p>‘Why, certainly, Mr. Raphael. I should be delighted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Good-bye, dear,’ called the President to
his wife; ‘don’t go too far away.’ Then he turned
to Raphael. ‘If you will catch hold of my fluke,
we’ll be down in a moment.’</p>

<p>Raphael did as he was told. The whale rounded
his back, lifted his tail out of water, and sounded
with a splash.</p>

<p>Down they shot into the twilight world of the
ocean. Raphael did not dare to breathe, and for
a long time did not even open his eyes.</p>

<p>At last they came to rest by the gateway of the
amphitheater fifty yards or so off bottom. Immediately
a host of small fish swam up beside them,
pushing and struggling for the best view of the
parade. Gray police sharks drifted slowly up and
down the line.</p>

<p>At a signal from the President, a huge sawfish
approached and saluted with a sweep of his tail.
He had small up-staring eyes and moved his saw
sideways like a scythe.</p>

<p>‘All present, Mr. President,’ he intoned.</p>

<p>The right whale returned the salute and
ordered, ‘Carry on.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>The sawfish saluted again and withdrew. The
light was growing dimmer. Shadows clung to
the rock floor, and Raphael had difficulty in seeing
the black cliffs across the arena.</p>

<p>The review began in silence. Two Admirals,
a swordfish and a sawfish, followed by four Rear
Admirals, passed slowly before the President. Behind
them swam, rank on rank, the Navy of the
Atlantic led by a brilliant band of drum and trumpet
fish. Eight deep they drifted past the reviewing
stand in massed companies of a hundred—swordfish,
sawfish, spearfish, porpoises, leopard sharks,
devilfish, sting rays, and even a company of octopi
which sculled along in the rear.</p>

<p>Behind them followed a second division composed
of smaller fish led by a sergeant major and
queen trigger fish with a host of flying-fish for
scouts.</p>

<p>When the Navy had swum majestically out of
the gateway, the crowd broke up into noisy little
groups of non-combatants. Raphael saw a gathering
of crabs arguing among themselves, while a
large blue-green lobster ambled over to join the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
fight. A starfish, unmindful of the excitement,
slept like a red rubber sponge on a coral ledge.</p>

<p>The ocean silence grew more oppressive as the
light failed. Raphael was watching a hermit crab
scuttle round hunting for an empty shell to hide
in, when the sea horse swam up.</p>

<p>‘That creature killed both of the octopi guards,’
he said. ‘There must have been a terrible fight.
What do you suppose he was doing here?’</p>

<p>‘He was probably one of the Sorcerer’s spies,’
answered Raphael.</p>

<p>‘Do you really think so?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder how much he discovered?’ mused
the Equerry. ‘I couldn’t find out from the other
fish. Some said one thing and some another.’</p>

<p>Just then the President swam up. He loomed
dark and indistinct, stirring up the phosphorus in
the water which shone about him like moonlight
around the edges of a black cloud.</p>

<p>‘If you will spend the night with us, while the
Navy drives that monster from the Sea, I will
show you many wonderful things,’ he urged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Raphael. ‘I know deep valleys in which all sorts
of curious fish live, fish with no eyes, fish with
windows in their stomachs, fish who light up the
pits of the Sea with their own lanterns, besides
numerous other serpents and sea beasts.’</p>

<p>For a moment Raphael was tempted to stay
and see these wonders. Then he thought of Cassandra
and gave up the idea. He was turning to
bid the President good-bye, when a small needlefish
darted up.</p>

<p>‘Mr. President,’ whistled the needlefish, ‘Admiral
Sawfish has sent me with dispatches informing
you that the enemy who invaded the
Council Chamber has entirely disappeared.’ And
he handed Mr. Right Whale a bundle of tightly
rolled seaweed.</p>

<p>Raphael was worried.</p>

<p>‘Mr. President,’ he implored, ‘will you help me?
The Sorcerer may have been warned already of
our plans to get into the castle.’</p>

<p>‘I shall help you as I promised,’ answered
the whale, ‘but I don’t know whether there is
any entrance to the castle under the sea. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
you will wait, I will have my scouts look for
one.’</p>

<p>‘If you would lend me a guide, I could scout
for myself,’ urged Raphael.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said the President. ‘I must apologize
for not providing you with an escort to
the island, but the Navy has gone. I am sure
you understand my position. My Equerry, however,
will guide you.’</p>

<p>Raphael bade the President farewell and sent
his respects to the First Lady of the Ocean and
her son.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ called His Excellency. ‘Good luck.
Farewell. Farewell.’</p>

<p>As he spoke the President drifted off, his voice
grew fainter and fainter, the darkness deepened,
and Raphael saw him no more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>EAGLES! EAGLES!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> bidding the President farewell, Raphael,
guided by the sea horse, returned toward the
highlands which jutted up to form the island of
the Sorcerer. It was very dark. Phosphorus
glowed about them in the ocean so that they
moved like comets through the night.</p>

<p>They had been traveling for some time when
a host of small mackerel darted by.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter?’ asked the sea horse of
one who paused a moment in his flight to look at
them.</p>

<p>‘A huge silver whale chased us, a whale larger
than any we had ever seen. It came out of those
cliffs.’ And the mackerel turned and pointed with
his tail.</p>

<p>‘Come on,’ said Raphael. ‘I don’t like this.’</p>

<p>Together the sea horse and the boy rushed
westward. After a time they came to the cliffs
themselves rising sheer and black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Here they stumbled over a wire cable which
ran along the ocean floor, and stopped for a moment
out of breath.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid the Sorcerer may have gone,’ panted
Raphael to his companion.</p>

<p>The sea horse did not answer him, but stared
intently into the gloom. At first Raphael could
see nothing, but at last he made out the outline
of a black doorway which gaped open in the
cliff.</p>

<p>‘The door! The door!’ shouted Raphael.</p>

<p>He swam closer and felt one of the edges with
his hand. It was made out of metal. Again he
tripped over the cable which led into the depths
of the chasm.</p>

<p>Raphael decided to follow it, and had started
forward when the sea horse warned him.</p>

<p>‘Be careful. That water is poisonous and foul.’</p>

<p>Raphael hesitated. A raw stagnant odor hung
about the mouth of the doorway which sickened
him.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t go in there if I were you,’ warned
the sea horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>‘But,’ objected Raphael, ‘I must find Cassandra.’</p>

<p>The sea horse quivered. ‘Good-bye, then. I
shall have to leave you here. I hope you won’t
think me a coward, but I couldn’t live a minute
in that water. Good luck.’</p>

<p>‘So long!’ said Raphael. He had become very
fond of the sea horse. ‘See you later, and thanks
ever so much for showing me about.’</p>

<p>‘See you later,’ echoed the sea horse sadly,
and turned away.</p>

<p>I shall never see him again, thought Raphael,
and shut his eyes as he stepped within the door.</p>

<p>It was cold and dead black inside. Raphael
paddled blindly upward feeling choked and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Suddenly without warning his head popped
above the surface, and he could look around.
He was in an immense cave hewn out of the
solid rock. At one end of it a cluster of brilliant
yellow lights was reflected in the oily black water
that licked at the foot of a great pier carved out
of the rock wall.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">‘I SHOULDN’T GO IN THERE IF I WERE YOU,’ WARNED THE
SEA HORSE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Raphael swam rapidly to a flight of landing
stairs which ran down into the water, and hauled
himself out. Shivering he turned toward a few
concrete steps which led from the pier up to the
door in the rock wall. The black cable he had
determined to follow also rose out of the water
and disappeared through this door.</p>

<p>This is the cable that the diver carried from
the Council Chamber, thought Raphael with sudden
inspiration.</p>

<p>Not knowing exactly what to do, the boy
mounted the steps and hurried along a smooth
concrete passageway which led directly into the
castle itself.</p>

<p>Forgetting the might and cunning of the enemy
in his impatience, he ran, his feet pattering along
the corridor like rain upon a shingle roof. Ahead
of him lights blazed, but no one stopped him, no
one appeared. He climbed a long flight of marble
stairs, and so came through a door of brass into
the great central hall of the castle. It was a huge
semi-circular room like a cathedral apse, lined
with winking elevator shafts that rose toward the
distant ceiling in blazing piers of metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Raphael hesitated for a moment and then followed
the cable through an open door. The room
into which he came was lined with rich imitation
oak paneling, and contained a large mahogany-stained
table. The cable ended here. In the center
of this table rested a steel box japanned in
black enamel. Halfway under the box lay a letter,
thin and white, on the outside of which was printed
in large letters <i>RAPHAEL</i>, and below this in
writing, ‘<i>In the event of his discovering this dictaphone</i>.’</p>

<p>Raphael hastily tore open the letter, and read
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Castle of the Sea</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Raphael</span>:</p>

<p>Through my dictaphone I have discovered
your plot to destroy me and my castle.
As I quite realize your ability to carry out
your plans so conveniently outlined, I have
made mine in advance. Cassandra and I
leave in a moment by submarine for a safer
retreat from your unwished-for attentions.</p>

<p>I trust that this letter will relieve you of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
further search, my only regret being that our
destination must be kept a secret from you.
Give my respects to all your old-fashioned
friends above and below.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright3">I remain</span><br>
<span class="indentright2">Your humble</span><br>
<span class="indentright">And devoted servant</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Mechanus</span></p>

<p>P.S. Cassandra sends her love.</p>
</div>

<p>Raphael stared at the letter a moment. Then he
ran to the door, and back into the great hallway.
Here he stopped and looked desperately about.
It was almost impossible to go back. He thought
of the roof, the roof and the eagles.</p>

<p>All the elevator doors stood open. Raphael
stepped into the nearest one and grasped the
starting lever. Up, up he shot with dizzy speed.
He wondered, as they passed floor after floor,
how tall the castle was. Where should he
stop? Perhaps the elevator would shatter itself
against the roof and drop him down the long
shaft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>The car jarred and came to a sudden stop.
Raphael jerked back the elevator door and
stepped into a long corridor. Peering up between
the landing and the cage, he saw the roof itself
just above him. He was on the top floor.</p>

<p>The boy ran along the corridor, and so came
to a room where he discovered a huge aeroplane
lying black and shining in its hangar. Raphael
did not even stop to look at the machine, but
hurried toward the great door which filled one
end of the room. It was made of steel, thick and
impassive. This was the entrance he had noticed
from the outside. He pushed at it frantically, and
beat his hands on the great locks. He might as
well have tried to overthrow the castle itself.</p>

<p>Raphael had nearly given up in despair when
he noticed a small lever on the wall. He reached
over and pulled it down. With a click and whir
the door swung smoothly back, and the boy
stepped out onto the roof.</p>

<p>‘Eagles! Eagles!’ he shouted.</p>

<p>In a moment Chief of All the Eagles in the
Sky wheeled into sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>‘Well, my boy,’ he said shortly, ‘you’ve been
gone a long time.’</p>

<p>‘The Sorcerer,’ choked Raphael handing him
the crumpled letter, ‘has escaped by submarine
with Cassie.’</p>

<p>‘I thought so,’ remarked Empyrean without
surprise. ‘My lieutenants reported earlier in the
evening that they had seen a large fish swim from
underneath the castle. It is easy to see such things
from the air.’</p>

<p>‘Then Cassie is lost for good?’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense,’ said the eagle. ‘The war has only
begun. I commanded my lieutenants to follow
the submarine, and bring us news. Come, we
must join them.’</p>

<p>Raphael scrambled upon Empyrean’s back, and
they winged their way into the night. Behind
them the empty castle of the Sorcerer rose in the
moonlight like a silver monument out of the black
sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>ON TO MECHANA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span> settled back between the eagle’s wings.
He felt tired and very hungry.</p>

<p>‘Here,’ shouted the eagle, ‘lean down.’</p>

<p>Raphael leaned down, and Empyrean handed
him something cold and slimy.</p>

<p>‘Thought you might be hungry,’ screamed the
bird.</p>

<p>Raphael held the thing up in the moonlight.
It was a fish.</p>

<p>I am an eagle. I must do as the eagles do,
reasoned the boy. At least this will keep me
from starving.</p>

<p>But the limp fish in his hand did not bring him
any desire to eat.</p>

<p>I wonder, he thought, whether this was one of
my friends under the ocean. Meanwhile he held
the fish almost at arm’s length.</p>

<p>In a few moments, however, hunger overcame
distaste, and he began to eat. Raw fish had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
its advantages. It was filling. Cats like raw
fish.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Raphael wiped his
hands carefully upon his feather suit and looked
about, lulled by the rise and fall of the great
wings. The moon, pale and remote, hung like a
silver plate in the sky.</p>

<p>The boy wondered how the eagle knew where
he was going. He remembered dimly that mariners
guide their ships over the sea at night by
the aid of stars. A meteor fell in a slow blaze of
sparks across the sky. Once he had been on a
boat at night....</p>

<p>When Raphael woke, it was early morning. In
the east the sun was rising, to the west, land
rimmed the horizon. Near at hand flew another
eagle.</p>

<p>‘Have they found the Sorcerer?’ called Raphael,
wide awake.</p>

<p>Empyrean nodded.</p>

<p>‘Where?’</p>

<p>‘Ahead of us.’</p>

<p>Other eagles joined them, sweeping down out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
of the sky in slow circles. Raphael could see the
white line of surf breaking over the bleak shore
back of which rose low hills covered with dark
firs.</p>

<p>They flew on rapidly and came in a few moments
to the head of a little bay where a sluggish
river emptied into the sea. At the mouth of the
river was a stone landing from which led a
straight white road.</p>

<p>‘Look! Look!’ yelled Raphael.</p>

<p>Alongside the jetty lay a huge silver submarine
with a gangplank leading from the conning tower
to the jetty. Deserted, it slept like an ocean monster,
gently rubbing against the pier head, while
little waves creamed against its shimmering sides.
There was no movement, no sign of life anywhere.
Only the sun glistening on silver steel decks.</p>

<p>Without lighting they flew inland, following
the river and the road which led away from the
coast. After a time mountains appeared on the
horizon, the river disappeared in low hills, and
only the slender road wound westward.</p>

<p>They rose slowly higher and higher as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
mountains pushed up into the sky. It was like
flying, Raphael thought, over a rumpled comforter
on a gigantic bed. Clouds gathered about
them, masses of cold, moist vapor shutting out the
earth below, smothering the mountains in their
soft folds, shutting them off into another world
with the sun and the blue sky.</p>

<p>At signal from Empyrean, all the eagles dove
through the clouds and, swooping in a great
circle, lit on top of a mountain which overhung
a broad valley that stretched westward as far as
Raphael could see. Through the center of this
valley flowed a broad river.</p>

<p>All the eagles gathered about Empyrean.</p>

<p>‘Does the Sorcerer live down there?’ asked
Raphael, pointing.</p>

<p>The eagle nodded: ‘To the west, there is a
great city called Mechana.’</p>

<p>The boy said nothing for a moment. He could
make out distant lakes like pools of melted lead.
Almost at his feet the road they had been following
wormed through the mountain range and
disappeared into the forest. It was cold on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
mountain. In spite of his feather suit, Raphael
shivered.</p>

<p>‘Does that road lead to Mechana?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the bird.</p>

<p>Raphael felt a sudden desire to run, to feel the
earth under his feet, to smell the clean forest
smell. Flying was fun, but....</p>

<p>‘Empyrean, would it be all right if I ran along
the road a little way to get warm?’ begged the
boy. ‘I’m frozen.’</p>

<p>The eagle nodded. ‘Follow the road,’ he ordered
curtly, ‘and when you reach the outskirts
of the city, wait for me. I shall join you there.’</p>

<p>Raphael scrambled eagerly down the mountain
to the road. Then, because the sun was warm
and the air crisp, he called upon the powers of
the antelope, and leapt forward in easy, tireless
strides.</p>

<p>The road led from the cedar-dotted uplands
into a valley of spruce. Logs covered with green
moss and moulding yellow leaves lay tangled in
the undergrowth. In the trees chickadees fluted
and chirped, and a hen partridge scuttled across
the road with her tiny yellow brood. Raphael
politely said ‘Good-morning,’ but they only fluttered
and stared at him out of brown, curious
eyes.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_056_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">‘DOES THAT ROAD LEAD TO MECHANA?’</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Raphael ran on. Half an hour later, as he
turned a sharp corner in the road, he nearly stumbled
over a large black bear and her cub. The
bear rose on her hind legs, her ears laid flat and
the lips of her tan muzzle drawn back showing
large white teeth.</p>

<p>Raphael stopped.</p>

<p>‘Good-morning,’ he said as pleasantly as he
could, though his voice shook.</p>

<p>The bear dropped back to the road with a soft
thud.</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ she grunted.</p>

<p>‘I am Raphael,’ he replied, ‘Commander of the
Elements under Gæa, the Earth Mother.’</p>

<p>By this time the cub had ambled forward to
inspect this strange creature dressed in black
feathers who smelt so queerly.</p>

<p>‘You are welcome then,’ growled the bear surlily,
and she sat back on her furry rump showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the leather soles of her hind feet. ‘It will be a
hot day.’</p>

<p>Raphael seated himself on a dry log at the side
of the road.</p>

<p>‘It is going to be a hot day,’ he repeated. ‘How
far is it to Mechana, the city of the Sorcerer?’</p>

<p>‘What Sorcerer?’</p>

<p>Then he told the bear about Mechanus, and
how he had stolen his sister Cassandra. Meanwhile
the cub snuffled about Raphael’s feet until,
becoming bored, he ambled off to root in a rotten
tree for grubs.</p>

<p>When Raphael stopped talking, the she bear
said: ‘I have heard of this Sorcerer. It is said
that he is like a man, and that there is a city a
long way to the west. But life is hard in the
woods. I find it difficult enough to feed my children,
and so I do not bother about what does
not concern me.’</p>

<p>‘But that’s just it,’ argued Raphael. ‘It does
concern you. To-day you have a forest to live in
and pools to drink from. But to-morrow the Sorcerer
may cut down this forest, the pools will dry,
the berries will disappear; you will find nothing
to feed on, and then how will your children
live?’</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">RAPHAEL SEATED HIMSELF ON A DRY LOG</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>The bear looked at him out of cunning little
eyes. ‘When that time comes, I shall move elsewhere
to other forests.’ And she wrinkled her
long nose in a yawn.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry for your sister,’ she added. ‘I know
how I should feel if a cub of mine were stolen.
But, after all, life in the forest is one danger following
another. We must eat. We must find
food, and that is difficult enough. Meanwhile the
Earth Mother who has always cared for us will
look after her people. There is no use in worrying
about to-morrow. For many years men have
hunted us, and yet we live.’</p>

<p>Raphael muttered, ‘The Sorcerer will be more
terrible than man.’</p>

<p>The bear stirred restlessly. ‘Well, perhaps as
you say, some day we may go. It is quite true
that life is growing harder for us. But then we do
not expect to live forever.’</p>

<p>Here the little cub broke in with a whimper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
‘Mamma, I’m hungry. You promised me a log
with fat slugs in it.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry I can’t help you,’ the bear said to
Raphael, ‘but a mother’s life is a hard one. Yes,
Lawrence, I’ll be right with you.’</p>

<p>Raphael watched them out of sight, and then
ran on down the road. Down through the valley
it wound until it reached the river, where it followed
the river-bank. Having been granted the
powers of an antelope, Raphael stopped every
now and then to nibble at the green buds and
tender shoots of late spring. In this way the day
passed.</p>

<p>Toward evening he came suddenly upon a
clearing hewn out of the forest. In the evening
light the white-topped stumps of freshly cut trees
looked like the gravestones of a bleak cemetery.
Raphael moved forward very slowly. The road
left the river and climbed a steep hill, and, as the
boy reached the top, he saw the city itself below
him.</p>

<p>‘There you are,’ said a familiar voice as a
shadow passed over his head, and Empyrean lit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
on the ground beside him. ‘I have been following
you for the last hour. What do you think
of it?’</p>

<p>Raphael stood and said nothing.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hill on which they stood dropped sharply
away into a plain surrounded by high hills. To
the south the river ran under pine bluffs. But
what amazed Raphael was the strange city that
lay before him. A thousand white skyscrapers
towered up from the plain in square masses of
marble and concrete, a city of giant cubes one
rising above the other. Overhead three aeroplanes
droned like black bees sharply outlined against
the evening sky.</p>

<p>As the twilight deepened, lights appeared in
the windows of the massive buildings. Raphael
could hear the roar of swiftly moving machinery
like the murmur of a far-off waterfall. Somewhere
in a huge skyscraper among those canyons of
concrete, Cassandra and the Sorcerer were hidden.</p>

<p>‘How shall I ever find her in that great city?’
thought Raphael, awed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>‘What shall we do?’ he asked Empyrean.</p>

<p>‘First of all we must prevent the Sorcerer from
escaping us,’ answered the eagle.</p>

<p>‘But how can we?’</p>

<p>‘Set a guard about the city.’</p>

<p>‘If we called a council of the animals, they
would help us,’ suggested Raphael.</p>

<p>The eagle gave the order to his lieutenants,
and then turned to Raphael.</p>

<p>‘My boy, to-morrow we shall test the power
of this Sorcerer. In the meantime you had better
sleep. The animals should arrive at dawn. Good-night.’
And Empyrean flew up into the branches
of a tall dead tree.</p>

<p>Raphael hunted for a dry spot to sleep. When
he had found an overhanging rock with pine
needles at the base, he curled up and lay down.</p>

<p>Overhead the stars were very bright. Raphael
was too excited to sleep immediately. Instead he
lay and thought about Cassandra. Where was
she? What was she doing? Was the Sorcerer
kind to her? What was the Sorcerer? Was he
so very dangerous that Gæa should be forced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
give him power over all the elements? Who
was Gæa? All the animals knew her and yet
none save Empyrean had ever talked of her.
She was a woman. The Mother of all living
things. Perhaps she was like Aunt Mary, only
more beautiful.</p>

<p>Thinking these things, he drifted into a troubled
sleep. He dreamt that he had been running
very fast and that suddenly he came to a little
house of logs in the woods. Over the door hung
an old board on which was burnt in rough letters,
<i>The House of Life</i>. He walked right in without
knocking and looked around. It was a bigger
house than he had thought. In one corner stood
a woman washing. She was large. Her arms
were red, and her hair was quite gray. She wore
a faded gray blouse and skirt. ‘Hello,’ said Raphael,
‘I—I didn’t know you were here.’ The
woman turned and smiled. She had a pleasant
face like the woman who washed clothes for Aunt
Mary and gave him cookies from the cooky jar.
‘Who are you?’ asked Raphael in the dream.
‘I am Gæa,’ said the woman and smiled again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Raphael liked her smile and her quiet gray eyes.
‘You will save Cassie, won’t you?’ he asked
anxiously. Then Raphael heard a scratching
noise, and Gæa went to the door and opened it.
In waddled two wolf cubs. They were very young
and soft. Gæa picked them up and dipped them
carefully in her washtub. Raphael started. The
water in the tub was bright red. It was the color of
blood. Gæa dried the cubs carefully and then set
them down. In a moment there was more scratching
at the door, and two ungainly fawns trotted
in. In this way cubs and fawns and numberless
wild babies arrived and were dipped until the
house was filled with them. Gæa gently continued
her work of baptism in spite of the frightened
protests of the young animals. At last there was
no place to stand at all. Raphael was suddenly
afraid, afraid of the house, afraid of the animals
which filled it. ‘Gæa, Gæa,’ he called desperately
and scrambled toward her. ‘Yes, dearie,’ she
answered reassuringly and opened her arms. He
was just able to reach their shelter and bury his
head in her blouse when he woke, his face pressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
into the leaves on which he lay. It was gray in
the forest about him. It was morning.</p>

<p>Raphael rose and shook himself. He noticed
quite suddenly that the woods about him were
filled with moving things. He could hear the
rustle of leaves and the occasional snap of a twig.
Mice scurried through the underbrush. A rabbit
hopped in sight and looked curiously about. A
deer peered at him from a thicket. He walked
thoughtfully to the top of the hill which overlooked
the city and sat down upon a rock. Here
Empyrean joined him.</p>

<p>The larger beasts arrived slowly—the moose,
the elk, the mountain lion and the grizzly bear,
the wolves and coyotes. Raphael, as he saw the
animals crowding about him, some frightened and
impatient, others bold and curious, realized that
much more than Cassandra’s liberty was wrapped
in the defeat of the Sorcerer. The Earth people
had come to help him at the bidding of Gæa,
their mother. With the Sorcerer destroyed they
would be saved from extermination, perhaps forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>When the meeting had been called together by
Empyrean, Raphael spoke:</p>

<p>‘Brothers,’ he said and pointed down the valley,
‘your home is being destroyed by the same
Sorcerer who has stolen my sister. You know
what his terrible engines have done to your forests
and your rivers and your children. While he
lives, you cannot hope to inherit the Earth, for
his people multiply and spread all over the world.
The time has come for us to attack him, attack to
save the places we live in and in which our ancestors
lived.’</p>

<p>The animals made assent each in his own
tongue and pressed closer, the deer timid and
trembling, the moose shoulder to shoulder with
the elk, the great bears and the mountain lions,
the wolves and the coyotes, brothers in one common
purpose.</p>

<p>Then Raphael called for scouts to discover if
possible where the Sorcerer lived and where Cassandra
was. All the animals volunteered to go
with one voice.</p>

<p>‘Let me go,’ said a mouse. ‘I’m small. No
one would pay much attention to a mouse.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>‘Of what use would a mouse be?’ hissed a
snake scornfully.</p>

<p>The rest of the animals said nothing.</p>

<p>‘I think,’ said Raphael, after a pause, ‘that
a mouse might be able to find out more than
any of the rest of us. He is small and his eyes
are sharp. Go quickly, Mouse, and return to
us.’</p>

<p>The little mouse, quite excited over the honor
done him, scurried off. Meanwhile the animals
lay in a circle about the clearing, the larger ones
crowding among the firs at the edge, the smaller
ones finding shelter in the grass and bushes.
Raphael sat on the council rock and looked out
over the city.</p>

<p>In an hour or two the mouse returned, hurried
and out of breath. The animals, who were the
first to hear him, rose and pressed about Raphael
to hear what was said.</p>

<p>‘Master,’ squeaked the mouse, ‘the way was
long and I have hurried. I went down through
the fields to a desert of stone with high cliffs on
all sides. Great boxes on wheels and many
silent walking things passed me. And so I came
away. Truly what could live in such a place?’</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_068">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">‘A MOUSE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND OUT MORE THAN ANY
OF THE REST OF US’</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>‘What sort of silent walking things?’ asked
Raphael.</p>

<p>‘Creatures like yourself but bigger. They smelt
of oil and frightened me.’</p>

<p>‘What else did you discover?’</p>

<p>‘No more, Master. What is there to learn
from such a waste of stone, and creatures that
do not talk?’</p>

<p>Raphael was bitterly disappointed at this lack
of news, and again called for volunteers. This
time a crow cawed louder than the others: ‘Let
me go, Master. I can fly over the city, and who
would suspect a black thief of a crow? Now
a proud eagle or a hawk might be killed by
our enemy. And,’ he concluded, slyly looking
at Empyrean, ‘what is more cunning than a
crow?’</p>

<p>So it was decided that he should go.</p>

<p>When the crow returned, he said that he had
flown a great way, but that he had little to report.
‘I saw,’ he said, ‘a great city below me with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
streets many miles in length, and on each side
of them huge buildings that took up many acres
of ground. In one place only I saw trees and
green growing things. By the river there is a
tower surrounded by a walled garden.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think Cassandra might be there?’
asked Raphael, excited.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ agreed the crow.</p>

<p>‘There is nothing so cunning as a crow,’ said
Empyrean sarcastically, stretching the talons of
his foot.</p>

<p>‘I wonder if we could reach the tower by the
river,’ Raphael mused aloud.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid not, Mr. Raphael,’ spoke up a voice.
The company parted about the speaker and
Raphael saw the sleek body of an otter with his
dark snake-like head. ‘I was down in the river
among the trout,’ he confessed, ‘and I know
the river is dammed in many places so that one
cannot pass to and fro.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Raphael. ‘In that case the
river would be out of the question.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied the otter. ‘I hunt and see strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
things. I have watched the river turn great
wheels.’</p>

<p>‘It is those wheels,’ explained Raphael, ‘which
make electricity for lights and heaters and for
running power motors.’</p>

<p>‘That may well be,’ said the otter. ‘As for me,
I do not understand man things. They are best
left to men.’</p>

<p>‘I agree with you,’ squeaked the mouse in a
flash of spirit. ‘I do not like boxes that run on
wheels.’</p>

<p>‘Nor,’ joined in the birds, ‘great insects that
fly through the air.’</p>

<p>‘We have been caught in traps and poisoned,’
bayed the wolves.</p>

<p>‘We are shot at with bullets for our horns,’
belled the moose.</p>

<p>All the animals began to cry out in their languages.</p>

<p>‘Peace,’ said Raphael. ‘We must spy out the
city of the Sorcerer if we are to destroy him and
bring back my sister.’</p>

<p>‘You had better go,’ counseled Empyrean.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
‘These creatures are fools. We shall wait here
for you.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll go,’ agreed Raphael. ‘Perhaps that will be
best. People of the Woods, will you circle the
city of the Sorcerer so that he may not slip away
from us? I shall spy on him myself.’</p>

<p>‘We will,’ came back the answer. ‘We are of
one mind in this.’</p>

<p>‘I may be gone a week. Will you guard faithfully?’</p>

<p>‘If we do this, Mr. Raphael,’ said a hare timidly,
‘who will save us from the wolves and the foxes?’</p>

<p>‘You need not worry,’ said Raphael confidently.
‘We are here for one purpose, the freedom
of all from the Sorcerer and his creatures,
and so have declared a universal truce.’</p>

<p>‘A truce! A truce!’ shouted the animals.
‘Death to the Sorcerer. Freedom forever.’</p>

<p>The hare looked nervous, but said nothing.
Then Raphael called together the leaders of the
wolves, the eagles, the bears, the wild cats, the
moose, the elk, and all the others, and urged them
to keep the peace for seven days. He sent this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
word by the otter to the trout and salmon in the
river. Then he once more cautioned the animals
to keep faith, saying that on them rested the success
of the expedition. After that Raphael made
his way to the city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE CAPTURE OF RAPHAEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span> walked down the hill toward the city
of the Sorcerer, and came shortly to a macadam
road which he followed cautiously, ready to hide
if anything should pass. He had not gone far
when a truck clattered by with two strange creatures
on the driving seat. They were not men,
though curiously like them in figure.</p>

<p>They were tall, and were dressed in dark gray
jumpers. Their hands were covered with what
appeared to be black gloves, and their feet were
cased in metal shoes. But the heads of these creatures
astonished Raphael most: the faces were gray
with two glassy eyes set under round projecting
foreheads, the noses were thick and short, the
chins dropped away rapidly below the mouth.
They appeared to have no ears, but each wore a
matting of rope hair. These evidently were the
servants of the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>Raphael tried to hide as the truck lumbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
by, but the creatures drove past without looking
at him. This encouraged the boy and he walked
more boldly. Gæa would look after him.</p>

<p>On each side of the highway rose large billboards
shutting out the view of the plain. <i>Welcome to
Mechana</i>, stood out in large letters beside the portrait
of a mechanical man, and there were others:
<i>Mechanicos Drink Mozzo Oil, the Health Fluid.
Keeps Out Rust, the Enemy of Long Life.</i> While
a few bore the more terrifying legend, <i>Does the
Repair Shop Frighten You? Use U-Kant-Beat-It
on the Joints.</i> Below this the following
letter was painted in red, ‘<i>I have used U-Kant-Beat-It
for ten years and can still kiss my
big toe.</i>’ It was signed <i>Mechanus, the Giant Sorcerer</i>.</p>

<p>Why, thought Raphael, this is just like
Uniontown.</p>

<p>He was entering the city now where there were
sidewalks. Tall buildings rose on each side casting
their shadows over the thoroughfare which
teemed with automobiles and heavy trucks. Mechanical
men passed him in a steady stream. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
they only knew that I had come to destroy them,
they might look at me, mused the boy.</p>

<p>He began to grow confused. Streets ran every
which-way. The tall skyscrapers shut out the
afternoon sun. It must be late, thought Raphael.
I wonder where I am? He could ask no one.
Probably no one would understand him.</p>

<p>Raphael was worried and walked faster. Turning
a corner suddenly, he nearly bumped into
four mechanical men who were blocking the sidewalk.
One of them was much larger than the
others. Raphael gasped, went pale, and half
turned to run. Before him stood the creature that
had stolen Cassandra—the Giant Sorcerer.</p>

<p>‘Hello, there,’ called the Sorcerer. ‘Don’t run.
It won’t do any good. I’ve been waiting for you
the last ten minutes. Come here, I won’t hurt
you.’</p>

<p>To gain time Raphael asked rather weakly,
‘Are you the Giant Sorcerer?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the Sorcerer easily. ‘Mechanus
is my name. These are my mechanicos.’ And
he motioned to the other three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>‘Where,’ faltered Raphael, ‘is Cassie?’ He
passed his tongue over his dry lips.</p>

<p>‘So you want to see Cassandra, eh?’ remarked
the Sorcerer. ‘She is safe enough. You may go,’
he said, turning to his three mechanicos. ‘I don’t
think Raphael will be so foolish as to try to escape.’</p>

<p>Cassandra is safe, thought Raphael. He could
fly. He was about to run and jump as high as he
could in the air when he heard the thrum of a
motor overhead. Above him floated a cigar-shaped
balloon around which an aeroplane flew
in graceful circles. There would be no use in
trying to escape by flight.</p>

<p>Well, thought Raphael, I shall go home with
him and find out where Cassandra is hidden. The
Sorcerer evidently did not mean to harm him.
Raphael began to take heart.</p>

<p>‘Promise me that you won’t try to escape,’ said
the Sorcerer. ‘I don’t want to tie you.’</p>

<p>‘I promise I won’t try to escape now,’ answered
Raphael.</p>

<p>The Sorcerer beckoned to a white limousine
driven by a mechanico which stood at the curb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>‘The Tower,’ said Mechanus when he and
Raphael, aided by the footman, had climbed in.</p>

<p>With a shriek of the horn, the white car made
off like a wild thing. It rocked over the city
streets, skimming through the traffic. As they
flew along, lines of great trucks stopped for them,
mechanicos dove out of their path, while mechanical
police waved them on.</p>

<p>Raphael sat silent, terrified at the frightful
speed.</p>

<p>‘Well, my boy,’ said the Sorcerer genially,
‘how do you like it?’</p>

<p>‘I hate it,’ said Raphael bitterly.</p>

<p>‘This is civilization,’ was the Sorcerer’s only
comment.</p>

<p>‘Wait until I show you the town,’ he went on
after a pause. ‘It is a beautiful sight. Avenues
any city might be proud of, no waste, no silly
parks cluttering up the place. I detest inefficiency.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you drive so fast?’ asked Raphael
sullenly as they skidded round a corner.</p>

<p>‘To save time, of course. Time is money.
Money is success. That is why we are successful.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>‘Then I don’t want to be successful,’ said
Raphael.</p>

<p>‘Pshaw. Nerves. You suffer from nerves. Now
my mechanicos have no nerves. It is one of my
great inventions.’</p>

<p>‘Why did you steal Cassandra?’ asked Raphael
suddenly.</p>

<p>‘Why did I steal Cassandra? Because I
wanted a daughter, a human child to live with
me.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe you,’ said Raphael rudely. ‘I
don’t believe you ever wanted a daughter.’</p>

<p>Soon after this they stopped in front of a high
wall with a gate of bronze. The Sorcerer got out
and Raphael followed him. Spinning a dial set in
one of the bronze panels, the Sorcerer opened the
door and nodded to Raphael to enter.</p>

<p>‘I change the combination every day,’ he said
dryly. ‘I shouldn’t bother to learn it, if I were
you.’</p>

<p>They passed through the gate into the brightest
garden Raphael had ever seen. Millions of
flowers grew in great beds, laid out in squares.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
The walks were broad and made of asphalt. In
the distance the boy could make out a little pond.
Overshadowing this garden of red and yellow and
green, Raphael saw a huge round tower of gray
brick.</p>

<p>‘This is where I live,’ said the Sorcerer. ‘Cassandra
lives with me.’</p>

<p>‘Is Cassie here?’ asked Raphael eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Cassandra,’ called the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>At his summons a little girl dressed in white
walked slowly from the other side of a large bush
in one corner of the garden.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she said listlessly. ‘What do you want?’</p>

<p>‘Cassandra, your brother Raphael is here.’</p>

<p>‘Cassie!’ shouted Raphael, running toward her.</p>

<p>The little girl raised her eyes slowly. ‘Hello,
Raphael,’ she said dully.</p>

<p>Raphael stopped as though he had been struck.</p>

<p>‘Cassie!’ was all he could say. ‘Cassie, what’s
the matter?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing. Nothing at all.’</p>

<p>Raphael was puzzled. There was something
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>‘Well, children,’ said Mechanus, ‘it must be
nearly supper-time. Show Raphael to his room,
Cassandra.’</p>

<p>Cassandra led the way through the stone-flagged
hall of the tower to an elevator. They
stepped in, and Cassandra pushed a button. The
elevator rose swiftly.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you well, Cassie?’ whispered Raphael.
‘You look sort of pale.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’m all right,’ said Cassandra. ‘Here’s
our room.’</p>

<p>But Raphael wasn’t satisfied.</p>

<p>The elevator stopped with a jerk, and Cassandra
opened the door.</p>

<p>It was a room full of light. Around the pale
yellow walls ran a band of pictures representing
fire engines, and trucks, and steam shovels, and
automobiles.</p>

<p>Raphael went to the western window and
looked out. The tower overlooked the garden
and beyond that Raphael could see the river
winding under distant pine bluffs. He was a
captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Several knocks shook at the door, and a
mechanico entered bearing a suit of clothes.</p>

<p>‘The Master wishes you to change, Mr.
Raphael,’ said the mechanico.</p>

<p>‘I won’t,’ said Raphael. ‘I prefer my feather suit.’</p>

<p>‘The Master said he wanted no magic nonsense.
You must change, Mr. Raphael.’</p>

<p>So the Sorcerer would take away his suit.
Would the power of Gæa go with it? Raphael
was afraid of this.</p>

<p>‘I won’t,’ he repeated stubbornly.</p>

<p>‘Sorry, Sir,’ replied the mechanico politely.
And then before Raphael could scream or cry
out, he was seized and his feather suit stripped
from him. He burst into angry tears.</p>

<p>‘Let my brother alone,’ spoke up Cassandra
sharply and flew at the mechanico. But he was
gone, and the door shut behind him. Raphael,
angry though he was, noticed that his sister’s
eyes were brighter and that her cheeks were
touched with pink.</p>

<p>The boy, trembling with rage, put on the
clothes the Sorcerer had given him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Just then a bell rang.</p>

<p>‘What is that?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Supper,’ said Cassandra.</p>

<p>‘I won’t go. I don’t want anything to eat,’
stormed the boy.</p>

<p>‘Come on, Raff, dear,’ urged Cassandra. ‘To
please me.’</p>

<p>‘Why should I please you? You weren’t glad
to see me a bit,’ said Raphael bitterly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Raff,’ wailed Cassandra, flinging her arms
round Raphael’s neck. ‘I’m so sorry. I was glad
to see you. But—but I feel as if I had just
waked up.’</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they went down to the dining-room.
Two places were set, one on either
side of the table.</p>

<p>‘Children,’ said Mechanus, ‘you are ten minutes
late.’</p>

<p>The children said nothing, but sat down.</p>

<p>‘I’ve had this porridge cooked especially for
you,’ said the Sorcerer proudly. ‘We mechanicos
use only one type of fuel.’</p>

<p>The Sorcerer sat down between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>While Raphael and Cassandra ate their supper
out of silver porridge bowls, the Sorcerer was
brought a large golden tankard. Throwing back
his head he poured at least a gallon of brown
fluid down his throat.</p>

<p>‘What is that?’ asked Raphael, forgetting his
anger in his curiosity.</p>

<p>‘That, my boy,’ said the Sorcerer, ‘is mineral
oil. It is all we mechanicos need in the way of
food and quite easy to take.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE GARDEN OF THE SORCERER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night Raphael dropped into a dreamless
sleep. When he woke in the morning, he thought
he was in Uniontown at home. There was
Cassandra’s bed, and Cassandra’s black head
upon the pillow. But the nursery walls were different.
They were yellow. Then he remembered
everything. He lay half asleep looking across the
room at the pictures in silhouette. Cassandra had
told him the whole story of her capture. She had
waked in the Sorcerer’s aeroplane and had been
taken to a castle with no windows. From this she
had been carried to a strange boat which also had
no windows. Then they had driven over a long
road in a racing automobile to the tower in the
city.</p>

<p>Cassandra was very vague about the details.
She had been sleepy. She had only really waked
when he, Raphael, had come. Well, there she
was, Cassandra, his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>‘Cassie,’ he called softly to see if she were
awake.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Cassandra, opening her eyes.</p>

<p>‘Let’s get up. What time is it?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p>Raphael got out of bed. Running over he pulled
the bedclothes off Cassandra with a jerk, shouting,
‘Ya, ya. Sleepy head. Going to stay all day
in bed.’ Cassandra hit at him with a pillow. Then
Raphael remembered the Sorcerer. As the Emissary
of Gæa he should behave with more dignity.
He walked over to the bathroom and slipped
on his new clothes.</p>

<p>When Cassandra and he went down to breakfast,
they found the Sorcerer seated in a chair
reading a magazine.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said he, ‘how did you sleep?’</p>

<p>‘Fine,’ said Raphael. ‘Did you sleep well?’</p>

<p>‘My dear boy,’ answered the Sorcerer, ‘I don’t
ever sleep. What use is sleep? It is a waste of
valuable time.’</p>

<p>Raphael glanced at the magazine that the Sorcerer
had been reading. It was lying open on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
table. As far as Raphael could see it was made
up of advertisements. <i>Use Flip Flop Arches for
Flat Feet. A Masterpiece of Mechanical Machinery.
Is Your Personality Red Hot? The
Mechanico Wearing Our Asbestos Underwear
Is Correctly Garbed For All Occasions.</i> And
there was a picture of a mechanico standing on
his head, underneath which Raphael read, <i>Do you
know better? Make your manners mechanical.</i></p>

<p>‘Aren’t there any stories in the magazine?’
Raphael asked.</p>

<p>‘Oh dear no,’ answered Mechanus. ‘This is
the Mechanico Journal Post. It is the last word
in magazine-making. We have left out all unnecessary
matter.’ And he showed Raphael the
cover on which was printed the picture of a mechanico
with his mouth open. This was done
handsomely in several colors.</p>

<p>After breakfast Raphael and Cassandra went
out into the garden to play. It was a wonderful
garden. There were all sorts of flowers growing
in it, flowers much bigger than Raphael had ever
seen before. Brick-red zinnias, crimson dahlias,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
blue corn flowers, columbine, roses, and tall sunflowers.
There were also many other flowers
Raphael could not name.</p>

<p>‘Why, I didn’t know all these flowers bloomed
so early in the spring,’ he said to Cassandra.</p>

<p>‘I guess they don’t, Raff. Anyhow, these are
fakes.’</p>

<p>Raphael bent over to pick one. It was true.
They were not flowers at all, but beautifully
made imitations.</p>

<p>‘What shall we play?’ asked Raphael.</p>

<p>‘Let’s play trains.’</p>

<p>‘But we haven’t any.’</p>

<p>‘Mechanus said,’ answered Cassandra, ‘that all
we had to do was to clap our hands, and a mechanico
would bring us anything we wanted.’</p>

<p>They both clapped their hands, and a mechanico
appeared.</p>

<p>‘Please,’ said Cassandra, ‘we want to play
trains.’</p>

GANG OF OTHER MECHANICOS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The mechanico disappeared and returned in a
moment bringing a large box which he carried on
his head. When the box was opened, Raphael gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>a cry of delight. Inside it were real trains that
ran by steam and were fired by tiny chips of coal.
They had electric lights in all the carriages. There
were also sections of track, and the mechanico
brought switches and drawbridges and stations
and a roundhouse with a turntable.</p>

<p>They laid the track through the jungle of
the false flowers, and played happily together
for an hour or two. Then Raphael got up and
stretched.</p>

<p>‘I wish,’ he said, ‘I had a larger train with an
engine that I could run myself.’</p>

<p>He clapped his hands. ‘Is there a bigger engine
about? An engine large enough for me to
ride in?’</p>

<p>The mechanico disappeared and summoned a
large gang of other mechanicos. They laid steel
tracks about the garden, and down the walks.
‘This is the life,’ said Raphael, delighted. ‘Come
on, Cassie, let’s run the big engine.’</p>

<p>They spent another two hours playing with
the big engine the mechanicos had brought them.
They rode round and round the garden, throwing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the switches, backing for loads of stones
they tossed into the dump cars, and blowing the
whistle.</p>

<p>‘Let’s never go back to Uniontown,’ said
Raphael as he stopped the train by the concrete
pond. ‘Let’s stay here and play forever.’</p>

<p>‘Raff,’ broke in Cassandra, ‘it’s my turn. Let
me drive.’</p>

<p>‘It’s not your turn,’ answered Raphael. ‘Besides,
you don’t know how to run an engine.
You’d break it.’</p>

<p>‘Yes I do, too,’ argued Cassandra. ‘You’ve
run the train for hours.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s mine, isn’t it? I asked for it.’</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t have thought of it if I hadn’t
told you what the Sorcerer said.’ And Cassandra
made a grab for the driving throttle.</p>

<p>‘Let go, Cassie, or I’ll push you off the train,’
said Raphael, angrily seizing her hand.</p>

<p>Cassandra burst into tears. Raphael suddenly
realized that they were quarreling the first day
they were together, fighting when they could
have anything they wanted. He was ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>‘All right, Cassie,’ he said. ‘You can run the
old engine.’</p>

<p>Cassandra brightened up. ‘Thank you, Raff,’
she said sweetly.</p>

<p>After lunch the Sorcerer took them to a room
Cassie had never seen before which held an enormous
doll’s house. It was a wonderful house.
Each room had its small furnishings. In the bedrooms
were bureaus and beds and rugs and electric
lights that turned on and off. In the dining-room
a miniature mechanico plied a vacuum
cleaner, in the kitchen a cook was cooking food
on a little electric range, while in the front parlor
sat a mechanical man listening to a radio machine
from which issued strange infinitesimal squeaks
and noises. ‘Just like the radio at home,’ laughed
Cassandra joyfully.</p>

<p>When they had grown tired of the doll’s house,
they returned to the garden and ordered two
small racing automobiles. They drove these up
and down the asphalt paths, stopping every once
in a while to change the tires for the fun of it.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the afternoon Raphael suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
thought, ‘I should like an aeroplane.’ And
he clapped his hands.</p>

<p>But this time he was denied. ‘The Master said
you were not to have an aeroplane,’ explained
the mechanico. ‘He was afraid you might try to
escape.’</p>

<p>Escape! What nonsense! He was having far
too good a time to escape.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ he said petulantly. ‘If I can’t, I
suppose that’s all there is to it.’ Raphael had forgotten
Gæa and the animals and Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>‘Cassie,’ he called, ‘I’ll race you round the
garden.’</p>

<p>That evening after supper, Mechanus took
them to a little theater in the tower, and showed
them moving pictures. Raphael and Cassandra
were very much excited when the lights were
shut off and the title, <i>A Miss Is As Good As
A Mile; A Mechanical Comedy, by the Mechanico
Motion Picture Studio</i>, flickered on the screen.
Aunt Mary seldom took them to the movies. She
said they were vulgar.</p>

<p>First there appeared a tall office building into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
which a mechanico hurried, dressed in a silk hat
and carrying an oil tankard in one hand. He was
shown falling into the elevator which took him
up many flights. On the way up he stepped in
the tankard. When the elevator stopped, he
tripped out and fell through an office door, knocking
off his silk hat. The subtitle read, <i>Oil Can</i>.</p>

<p>In the office a second mechanico actor rose from
the desk at which he was working and calmly
kicked his visitor through the window, tankard
and all. The first mechanico lit on his head in the
street amidst a splatter of glass with the battered
tankard in one hand. He rose and ran to an automobile
standing near and got in. The whole machine
fell apart, the wheels careening off in various
directions. The subtitle to this was, <i>Only a
Motor Car</i>. There was much more of this kind of
fun.</p>

<p>‘Children, don’t you think that is funny?’
asked the Sorcerer when the reel had come to an
end.</p>

<p>‘Not very,’ said Raphael doubtfully. ‘What
was it all about?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>‘That was modeled from the very best moving
picture comedies,’ answered the Sorcerer, ‘keeping
the funniest features in each.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ agreed Raphael politely.</p>

<p>‘Would you like to see a melodrama?’ went on
the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>‘No—no, thank you.’</p>

<p>‘Do you want to see one, Cassandra?’</p>

<p>But Cassandra had already fallen asleep.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next afternoon the Sorcerer told Raphael
and Cassandra that he would show them the
wonders of his city.</p>

<p>‘Then you will observe,’ he said pleasantly,
‘how much more cheaply we can live than man.
When you have seen my wonderful mechanicos,
you will never want to return to Uniontown.’</p>

<p>They left the tower and walked slowly through
the city. Cassandra skipped gayly along beside
Raphael, who tried to keep step with Mechanus.
They soon became accustomed to the noise of
the automobiles and trucks which rushed up and
down the streets, the screaming brake bands, and
the racing motors. With the high buildings leaning
above them, it was like walking in the bottom
of a deep river canyon.</p>

<p>At last they came to a skyscraper, taller than
the rest, which had carved in stone over its mammoth
doors, <i>Big Business Building</i>. Into this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the Sorcerer turned followed by Raphael and
Cassandra. The great marble hallway was decorated
with colored pictures of lumps of coal and
tins of oil, while over the elevator shafts which
faced the door there hung a life-size portrait of
the Sorcerer himself done in oils. They walked to
one of the elevators and stepped in. A mechanico
sat on a stool in one corner, his hand on the starting
lever.</p>

<p>‘Go-Getter or Will-to-Power, sales or production?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘What does that mean?’ asked Raphael.</p>

<p>‘The Executive Offices,’ commanded the Sorcerer.
Then he explained to Raphael that Mechanico
Limited was divided into two large
groups, those that manufactured and those that
sold what was manufactured, Go-Getters sold
and Will-to-Powers produced.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Raphael. Cassandra did not bother
to listen.</p>

TRIED TO KEEP STEP WITH MECHANUS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the meantime the elevator flew to the top
of the building thirty stories high and returned
twenty-nine. The elevator man opened the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
and pointed to the right, ‘First door on your
left.’</p>

<p>They stepped out. Before them stretched a
corridor of doors with pearl-gray glass panels
which bore the words <i>Millions Ltd</i> in raised gilt
letters, while below it was traced the slogan, <i>The
Go-Getter Gets</i>. Raphael wondered what the Go-Getter
got, but the Sorcerer had opened the door
and they walked in.</p>

<p>As they entered, a hundred mechanical clerks
seated before a hundred flat-topped desks whirled
in a hundred revolving chairs and stared at them
and then whirled back again. Goodness, thought
Raphael, they must do a lot of business. For on
each desk were ten shiny black telephones.</p>

<p>‘Wait here a moment,’ said the Sorcerer, and
disappeared behind a door marked <i>Private</i>.</p>

<p>‘Please,’ said Raphael to one of the nearest
clerks, ‘what are you doing?’</p>

<p>‘I’m figuring production and sales.’</p>

<p>‘Production of what?’</p>

<p>‘Why, mechanicos, of course.’</p>

<p>‘Are you a Will-to-Power?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>‘No. I’m the sales department.’</p>

<p>‘Then you’re a Go-Getter.’</p>

<p>‘The Go-Getter gets,’ began the figure automatically.
‘He increases his personal efficiency.
No man is bigger and better than his sales.
That’s what keeps me busy—bigger and better.’
And he continued cranking the adding machine
in front of him.</p>

<p>Just then the Sorcerer beckoned to them from
a door in the wall. There were three doors lettered
<i>Very Private</i>, <i>Really Very Private</i>, and
<i>Not So Very Private</i>. Through this last one
they followed Mechanus.</p>

<p>‘Raphael and Cassandra, these are the Executives.
They plan the work and are responsible
for its success.’</p>

<p>At this ten mechanicos with immense bulging
foreheads rose and bowed. ‘Pleased to see you,’
they said with one voice. ‘Pleased indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen,’ went on the Sorcerer, ‘here are
the children I have spoken about. They are
young and fairly adaptable. Study them. Our
working mechanicos can be improved. For instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
these children feel pain. It is a wise provision
of nature. If our mechanicos felt pain they
would do themselves less injury, and there would
be less work for the repair shop. A repair shop
is a sign of inefficiency.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen, I repeat that much may be learned
from this boy and girl.’</p>

<p>‘If only,’ breathed an Executive softly, ‘mechanicos
could create other mechanicos as the
animals give birth to other animals, it would
save a great deal of raw material.’</p>

<p>‘Some day, perhaps, we may manage that,’ answered
the Sorcerer casually. Then he turned to
the children. ‘Come on, Raphael and Cassandra, I
want to show you the rest of the city before dark.’</p>

<p>They all bowed politely to one another.</p>

<p>Mechanus, Raphael, and Cassandra left <i>Big
Business Building</i> and took a taxicab for the
outskirts of the city. While they were being jerked
along at a tremendous speed, Raphael asked the
Sorcerer if they made any child mechanicos.</p>

<p>‘Goodness, no,’ answered Mechanus. ‘Childhood
is nothing but waste. A child mechanico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
could not do the work of a man, and he would
drink almost as much oil.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t mechanicos have any fun at all?’</p>

<p>‘A mechanico,’ said Mechanus, ‘doesn’t know
what fun is.’</p>

<p>‘I’m glad I’m not a mechanico,’ said Cassandra.</p>

<p>‘Are you, my dear?’ said Mechanus and gave
her a queer look.</p>

<p>The taxicab stopped with a jerk outside of a
huge factory of concrete and glass on the side of
which was painted in gold letters, <i>Mechanico
Mammoth Machine Works</i>. The Sorcerer opened
a side door and Raphael and Cassandra followed
him inside. As the door shut behind them the roar
of machinery sounded like an angry waterfall.</p>

<p>‘Wait a moment here,’ said the Sorcerer, ‘while
I look for the Superintendent. You may go through
that door there, if you want to.’ And he pointed
to a steel door on which was painted, <i>For Employees
Only</i>.</p>

<p>Raphael and Cassandra went and peeked
through. As they opened the door the noise of
revolving machinery became louder, almost deafening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
them. Inside at a work bench stood two
mechanicos adjusting artificial arms and hands.</p>

<p>‘If you don’t produce better goods, twenty
thousand fifty-one, the Master will take you
apart,’ one was saying to the other. ‘The last
lot were a little stiff at the elbow.’</p>

<p>Raphael could not imagine what they were
talking about.</p>

<p>‘Well, it isn’t my fault, two thousand fifty-six.
The Master ordered clerks and I gave him clerks.
Then what do you suppose he did? Slapped those
arms right onto workers. Of course, they couldn’t
stand the strain. They weren’t built for it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you want to watch out or you will land
in the repair shop.’</p>

<p>The men continued passing metal arms onto a
moving band that ran slowly by. Raphael suddenly
realized that they were making parts to
mechanical men. The men were made and put
together like automobiles.</p>

<p>‘It’s curious,’ twenty thousand fifty-one went
on, ‘how sometimes things seem to go wrong. I
remember a painter who took to putting spots on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
a building when he should have been painting
stripes. He said it looked prettier that way, and
called it art or something. Of course the Master
took him apart. Sent his head back to the factory
with a complaint. They fixed it, and now that
fellow paints as good stripes as any one. Three
thousand and seven, I think his number was.’</p>

<p>Just then the Sorcerer appeared and motioned
Raphael and Cassandra to follow him. They
walked down a long corridor, following the belt,
on which lay thousands of arms. As they drew
near the end of the concrete passageway, the
noise of moving wheels and pounding hammers
grew deafening.</p>

<p>‘What do you think of this?’ shouted the Sorcerer
as they entered a huge room covered with
a dirty glass roof.</p>

<p>Raphael, holding Cassandra’s hand, stared in
wonder at the broad belts which passed endlessly
along, and at the great wheels that revolved in this
gloomy cavern. Hundreds of mechanicos bent
over complicated machinery. Daylight filtered
dimly through the glass roof and windows, and
was made more hideous by electric lights, which
shone hard and blue over the moving chaos.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE THING CAME SUDDENLY TO LIFE MARCHING OFF IN
COMPANY WITH FIFTY OTHERS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>As he grew used to the seeming disorder,
Raphael saw that heads, legs, bodies, and arms
were being brought by lesser belts to a great
central one, where workmen were busy putting
the pieces together.</p>

<p>‘We can make ten thousand mechanicos a day
in this one room alone,’ shouted the Sorcerer,
‘and there are a hundred rooms bigger than this
within the city.’</p>

<p>It reminded Raphael of an automobile factory
he had seen in Uniontown.</p>

<p>When the parts were all assembled, numbers
were engraved on the back of each figure and a
letter indicating the type of work the mechanico
was suited for. Then the lifeless body was encased
in a gray uniform and stood on its feet.
Other mechanicos poured oil down its throat,
shook it violently, and the thing came suddenly
to life, marching off in company with fifty others
to take up the burden of work. Over all these
Mechanus was master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>‘Come,’ said Mechanus, ‘I have something
more to show you.’ Again Raphael and Cassandra
followed him from the room down a corridor
lit by electric lights.</p>

<p>‘Do mechanicos ever die?’ asked Raphael in
the comparative quiet.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Mechanus. ‘But every mechanico
has so many motions he can make and no more.
Then he has to go to the repair shop and be remade.
If there is a mistake in his assembly, then
he may have to go sooner.’</p>

<p>They came in a few moments to an unlit passageway
which branched off at right angles.</p>

<p>‘What is down there?’ asked Raphael.</p>

<p>‘That is the repair shop,’ said the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Cassandra, ‘I don’t want to go there.’</p>

<p>It looked very dark down that corridor.</p>

<p>They walked on about a hundred yards to a
door which the Sorcerer unlocked. When they
stepped inside, they were in a gigantic warehouse
full of metal cylinders and complicated electrical
machines. The Sorcerer stopped, and they stood
looking about them.</p>

<p>‘What are these things?’ asked Raphael.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>‘These,’ said the Sorcerer proudly, ‘are what
I particularly wished to show you. They are
poison gas and death-ray machines.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Raphael, awed.</p>

<p>‘I have here,’ went on the Sorcerer, ‘enough
gas and sufficiently powerful death-ray machines
to destroy all the living things on this earth. A
man invented me. I have invented these. The
time is close at hand. Already I have fifty million
mechanicos to people the earth, when every living
thing is gone.’</p>

<p>‘Then what do you want Cassie and me for?’
asked Raphael, frightened by the terrible seriousness
of the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>Mechanus smiled. ‘There are still a few imperfections
in our mechanicos. There are certain
qualities possessed by man with which we wish
to equip our mechanical men. When we kill the
living, we shall lose our useful models unless
precautions are taken. This is the reason I stole
your sister—to study her. This is also why I
haven’t killed you. You have been a nuisance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
but now I think I have rather clipped your
wings, eh?’</p>

<p>Raphael shuddered. Mechanus would wipe out
every living thing: Aunt Mary, Uniontown, the
animals. Cassandra began to cry.</p>

<p>‘You had better join me and the mechanicos,’
said the Sorcerer slowly. ‘Together we shall
rule the world.’</p>

<small>TO SAVE THE WORLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night Raphael lay in bed and thought for
a long time. Mechanicos. The Sorcerer was
building over ten thousand a day. Already he
had built fifty million. More than Raphael could
imagine. When he had many more, he would
spread the poison gas and shoot the death-ray
round the world. Raphael, Cassie, Aunt Mary,
and all mankind would be killed. There would
be no living thing upon the earth.</p>

<p>‘There are still a few imperfections in our
mechanical men,’ the Sorcerer had said; ‘that is
the reason I stole your sister—to study her. You
had better join me and the mechanicos. Together
we shall rule the world.’</p>

<p>Raphael was sick of mechanical life. He was
afraid. He remembered the animals waiting patiently
outside the city. They had trusted him and
he had failed them.</p>

<p>‘Cassie,’ whispered the boy, ‘are you awake?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>‘Yes,’ whispered Cassandra.</p>

<p>Raphael got out of bed and went over and
perched himself on Cassandra’s counterpane.</p>

<p>‘Cassie,’ said Raphael, very low, ‘do you want
to go home?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ whispered Cassandra, sitting upright.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m going back to join the animals. We
shall destroy the Sorcerer and his city, and then
you can go home with me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Raff,’ wailed Cassandra, ‘don’t leave me
here. Take me with you.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I can’t, Cassie. Gæa hasn’t given
you any power at all, and I don’t see how I could
get you out of the tower and over the wall.’</p>

<p>‘But, Raff,’ sniffled Cassandra, ‘if you destroy
the city, you may kill me doing it.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve been thinking of that, Cassie. There is a
cellar in the tower. When the attack comes, hide
there. It’s the only chance.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Raff, I shall be so scared.’</p>

<p>‘I know, Cassie, but if I don’t go, how can I
save you? Besides, I promised the animals I
would help them.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>‘But, Raff, why not let Gæa help them?’</p>

<p>‘She does, Cassie, through me. I don’t see
how she can do any more unless she destroys the
city herself. I am her messenger. I must not fail
her. The animals alone can’t fight the Sorcerer.
He would kill them with the death-ray or his
poison gas.’</p>

<p>‘Raff, do you think there is such a person as
Gæa?’</p>

<p>Raphael was startled. Sometimes he had
wondered. The Mother of All Things. Well, he
could fly—he had never been able to do that
before. He remembered suddenly, with panic,
that his feather suit had been taken away. Could
he still fly? The Sorcerer evidently didn’t think
so. He must take the chance. It was their only
hope.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he answered Cassandra after a pause.
‘I believe in Gæa. I can fly and live underneath
the sea. I could never do that before.’ Cassandra
was half convinced.</p>

<p>‘Cassie,’ said Raphael, ‘I must go now.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Cassandra faintly. She looked pale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
and frightened with her dark hair falling down
about her face. Raphael was frightened himself.</p>

<p>‘If you’ve got to go, Raff,’ said Cassandra
bravely, trying to keep her mouth from trembling
and the tears out of her eyes, ‘come back soon.’
And she threw her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>Raphael kissed his sister and then stole to the
window. Could he fly in these white pajamas?
They belonged to the Sorcerer. Was Gæa still
looking after him or had he lost her friendship
through his lack of faith?</p>

<p>‘My dear boy,’ said a voice in the doorway,
‘come away from that window and climb into
bed. You’ll catch your death of cold.’ It was
Mechanus himself.</p>

<p>Raphael gave a startled cry and dove head first
through the window. He was very frightened
and beat the air frantically with his hands. Slowly
he checked his fall and righted himself. He could
fly. Gæa still watched over him.</p>

<p>He heard laughter from the window and the
voice of the Sorcerer. ‘Bravely done. When you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
get tired of your animals, come back. We shall
expect you in a day.’</p>

<p>He had escaped. The Sorcerer had let him go.
Raphael wondered why. He felt vaguely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>In his clumsy fashion Raphael flew across the
city of Mechana to the fields nearest the hill on
which he had left the animals. He lit heavily and
walked on in the moonlight as rapidly as he
could. The smell of green things and rich earth
refreshed him. Suddenly a rabbit scurried across
his path.</p>

<p>‘Hullo,’ said Raphael. But the rabbit did not
stop. Raphael was more troubled when he saw
a fox slink from behind a bush and drift into the
woods.</p>

<p>The boy hurried on, anxious to reach the meeting
hill. He was almost at the summit when he
heard the snarl of wolves fighting. The path led
through a spruce thicket and then out to the open
crown of the hill. There the sight that met his
eyes made him cry out.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve gray wolves stood crowding and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
jostling about something that lay still upon the
ground.</p>

<p>‘Stop it! Stop it, I tell you!’ shouted Raphael
as he ran forward. ‘You curs! You beastly
curs!’</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the wolves drew back
eyeing him cunningly. They still panted from the
chase, and saliva dripped from their red, jerking
tongues. Only one glance was necessary to see
that the deer they quarreled over was dead. It
lay tongue out, staring up at Raphael out of unseeing
eyes. Blood ran in thin streams down its
neck, dropping slowly on the leaves below. The
slim legs were bent and limp.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you fools! You fools!’ the boy almost
cried. ‘How can you conquer the Sorcerer if you
murder one another?’</p>

<p>‘We were hungry,’ said the leader of the pack.
‘We must eat.’</p>

<p>‘Where are the eagles?’ demanded Raphael.</p>

<p>‘They are asleep.’</p>

<p>‘Summon them,’ ordered Raphael contemptuously.
‘Summon all the animals.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>The wolves left gladly. They were ashamed
at being caught and glad to get away.</p>

<p>Raphael sat down on a rock, chin in hand.
The animals had failed him. They had not kept
faith. But he had not kept faith either. Betrayer.
Betrayed. The Sorcerer had known this. That
was why he had allowed him to escape so
easily.</p>

<p>Slowly the clearing filled. The animals approached
furtively: the deer, the rabbits, the field
mice, the porcupines, and the snakes. But the
wolves did not appear, nor the mountain lions,
nor the bears, nor the weasels. Suddenly the
eagles landed, dropping down like shadows out
of the moonlight.</p>

<p>‘Where are the others?’ Raphael asked Empyrean
sternly.</p>

<p>‘They have gone, Raphael,’ said the eagle in
a cracked voice.</p>

<p>The boy sat bowed with unhappiness. Then
he said slowly, ‘There has been hunting. The
truce has been broken.’</p>

<p>‘That is life,’ answered Empyrean. ‘They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
thought you were never coming back. They were
hungry. They must live.’</p>

<p>‘Then whom can I trust?’ asked Raphael.
‘Whom can I trust, if we defeat this Sorcerer?’</p>

<p>Chief of All the Eagles in the Sky said nothing.</p>

<p>Raphael rose slowly. He would return to Cassandra
and the Sorcerer and stay with them forever.
Then he saw again the mechanicos marching
to work. Right, left. Right, left. He heard
the grinding of a million wheels. He saw a battery
of buzz saws gnawing down the forest. He
remembered the cold streets, the tall buildings.
Bigger and better. The Go-Getter gets. Gets
nothing. It would be better to be dead. He
would save the world in spite of everything. He
would save Cassie and himself.</p>

<p>‘Dismiss the council,’ he ordered Empyrean.
‘I shall destroy the city myself.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>THE BATTLE OF THE CITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span> raised his right hand and called upon
the storm. As he did this, thunder was heard and
black clouds formed in the west. For a moment
silence brooded over the plain, broken only by
the deep roar of the machine city. The light failed
rapidly and a saffron glare shadowed the hills and
turned the fields to yellow-green. Great thunder-clouds
rolled up like monstrous sulphur ships and
advanced on the city of the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>At first a gentle wind rustled the still leaves of
the forest and bent the grass in rippling waves as
it swept forward in gusts across the plain. All
the animals crept away in terror to their lairs and
forms in the thickets until the boy was left alone
with the eagles.</p>

<p>A blue-white flash of lightning forked across
the sky and split into shreds of thunder, as the
storm burst over the city. The trees that skirted
the fields in a thin fringe bent like tassels in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
wind. Lightning flashed in swift, stabbing spasms,
ripping the clouds apart, while the noise of thunder
deafened Raphael with the weight of crackling,
tumbling sound. Although the clouds hid
the sun, the whole plain was lit by the shivering
glare of lightning. Rain fell in slanting, driven
sheets.</p>

<p>But the Sorcerer had not planned idly. At the
first thunderbolt the whole city awoke to swarming
activity. The skyscrapers suddenly bristled
with metal spines. From where he stood, Raphael
could make out armies of mechanicos swarming
like black ants over the roofs, covering them with
twisted metal nets, which caught the lightning
and wove it into baskets of fire. Lightning crackled
up and down the sides of the great buildings
in great loops and whorls, while molten metal
splashed through the air in white-hot showers as
it fell hissing to the ground below.</p>

<p>The wind howled in angry gusts, sweeping
the great skyscrapers clean of their mechanical
men, uprooting trees, tearing down steel sign-boards
like scraps of paper, while the river rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
and swept foaming and yellow across the plain,
bearing on its surface trees and stumps and
broken branches.</p>

<p>The whole city will be swept away, thought
Raphael, and the Sorcerer will surrender. I hope
Cassie is safe. But he was frightened for all that
and shivered where he stood. Would the river
wash away the garden walls? So be it.</p>

<p>Then Raphael saw an army of mechanicos appear
upon the banks of the river, followed by
tractors towing strange engines. Plows and steam
shovels seemed to rise out of the tortured earth
in companies. To Raphael watching on the hill,
ditches and canals formed as though dug by
magic. Through the rain, the boy could see a
huge wall rising slowly, pushing back the river
from the city, which loomed up like a craggy
island in a yellow sea.</p>

<p>The sound of mighty conflict came as the mechanicos
labored. The roar of steam engines and
beating hammers offset the throaty growl of the
river. Fast though the water flooded down upon
them, the city walls rose faster. Great ditches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
drained off the river. The mechanicos would
save Mechana.</p>

<p>Raphael was appalled. The Sorcerer would
win. He would never save Cassandra. The Sorcerer
would destroy the living world. It was no
use, he would go down to the plain and surrender,
he would beg Mechanus for the life of his sister,
he would exchange, give himself up. But what
use would that be? The Sorcerer could now take
them both. Raphael commanded the storm to
cease. ‘I won’t give up! I won’t give up! I’ll
make other plans.’ Raphael walked desperately
up and down. ‘Gæa, Gæa,’ he muttered; ‘help
me.’</p>

<p>Then an idea came to him. He would call upon
the earthquake and the volcano, and so overturn
the city.</p>

<p>Raphael raised his right hand fiercely and called
once more upon Gæa.</p>

<p>Almost instantly plumes of smoke rose from
the hills which circled the city of the Sorcerer
and the whole earth shuddered. A light haze
drifted lazily up from the city. Then with a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
roar the top of the highest hill of all burst
in a cloud of black smoke, and ashes began to
fall silently, carried by the light breeze. They
shrouded the sun, and twilight deepened into a
thicker darkness. In the gloom, Raphael could
see the mountain pouring out fire and smoke like
a huge blast furnace.</p>

<p>Raphael looked about. All the animals had
deserted him save the eagles, who clustered behind
him, feathers drooping.</p>

<p>‘This ought to destroy the city,’ he said to
Empyrean.</p>

<p>‘We shall see,’ answered the bird.</p>

<p>Everything was still. After the thunder, it
seemed that the world was dead. No sound
came from the city. The great machines were
silent. In the half light ashes continued to fall
swiftly like snow.</p>

<p>‘Look!’ suddenly screamed an eagle. Raphael
looked.</p>

<p>A great wall of black lava was spreading from
the hills toward the city. It rolled down from the
mountain as molasses rolls over a colony of ants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
It oozed up from the bowels of the earth like sap
welling from a frightful gash. The boy heard for
the first time the awful hiss of steam.</p>

<p>Slowly the lava struck the edge of the city and
welled over it, wiping the great buildings from
sight. Leveling, swallowing, drowning everything
in its terrible path, it advanced toward the
heart of the city.</p>

<p>As though at a signal a terrible confusion of
noise broke out in Mechana. Bells tolled, whistles
blew, searchlights groped blindly through the
falling ash. There was a frenzy of activity. An
earthquake rippled over the plain which opened
in livid fissures. Raphael heard the dull crash of
masonry as it toppled and fell.</p>

<p>‘The walls of the city!’ screamed the eagles
exultantly. Raphael could hear the shriek of
straining machinery as steam shovels, tractors,
trains, and giant engines labored trying to restore
order out of chaos. But steadily, silently the lava
flowed on, the ashes fell.</p>

</figure>

<p>Raphael began to worry about Cassandra.
‘I can stop this volcano,’ he tried to reassure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
himself, ‘by raising my hand. But how long
would the Sorcerer hold out? Until he and Cassandra
were buried in the awful ruin of the city?’
The boy began to walk nervously up and down,
up and down. The eagles huddled behind him.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed. There was still
no sign of surrender, though the noise of conflict
in the city was dying away. Now and then a
powerful explosion would shake the plain. And
a strange smell filled the air. Raphael thought
with sudden horror of the poison gas. Had the
tanks exploded? Was this the end? The destruction
of everything? Instead of saving Cassandra
and the world, had he hurried on the fate which
hung over them? At any rate, the Sorcerer would
never rule. The boy stamped to and fro, muttering,
‘Surrender, surrender.’ He began to feel
sick. Was he dizzy? He stopped and looked intently
at the river. No, he wasn’t dizzy yet. Gas.
Poison gas. How terrible!</p>

<p>A puff of wind sprang up, and drove the ashes
in eddying clouds. Raphael suddenly saw above
the city a great white balloon floating. How long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
had it been there? What was it doing? Then he
knew. The Sorcerer had surrendered. It was
the white flag of failure. The ashes blew back
again and settled over the city. Was he too late?
Had he seen in time? Raphael raised his hand
and commanded the volcano to cease.</p>

<p>The war was over.</p>

<p>Immediately the volcano was still. The earth
ceased to rumble, the ashes fell no more, and
overhead the sun broke through the clouds in a
sudden golden flame over the desolation below.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>VICTORY AND DEFEAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphael</span> ran down the hill to the plain followed
by the eagles, who trailed him in great fluttering
hops. Ruin spread before them: blackened walls
smouldered under the bright sky; no sound broke
the stillness except the hiss of escaping steam;
white smoke drifted up like summer mist from a
lake.</p>

<p>They came to broad rivers of lava which they
flew across. In the thick stream was caught
wreckage; automobiles and trucks with bent and
twisted wheels lay upside down like dead insects.
Steam engines and steam shovels, railroad and
fire engines, crumpled and cast aside, lay scattered
here and there, dried currants in a monstrous
pudding.</p>

<p>When they reached the center of the city after
an hour’s toil, walking became impossible. Heaps
of broken brick and torn steel girders blocked
every avenue, while empty chasms of concrete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
that had once been cellars made pits that were
deep and dangerous. The subway lay open like
a raided mole’s burrow. Only the tower of the
Sorcerer surrounded by its gray wall frowned
down upon the waste land.</p>

<p>Then Raphael saw the Sorcerer and Cassandra
standing by the gate of bronze. Cassandra was
waving excitedly to him.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Raff,’ she cried as she ran forward and
threw her arms around his neck, ‘I’ve been so
scared!’ The Sorcerer said nothing.</p>

<p>Raphael tried to look as dignified as he could.
Pushing Cassandra gently to one side, he walked
toward his enemy.</p>

<p>‘Do you surrender?’ he demanded, his heart
beating very fast.</p>

<p>‘I surrender,’ said the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>Surrender! Now that the war was over, Raphael
did not know what to do. The Sorcerer was
in his power. And yet he knew of no prison in
which he could shut him forever. Nor did he particularly
wish to kill him; in fact, he was not at
all sure he could. Then Raphael realized bitterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
that lasting victory is not won by war. If he were
my friend, I might persuade him to stop making
mechanicos, thought the boy.</p>

<p>The eagles, who had formed in line behind
Raphael, glared at their enemy out of hungry
eyes.</p>

<p>‘Well, what are you going to do?’ asked the
Sorcerer easily. ‘Cut off my head? Put me in
prison? Let the animals rule the earth?’</p>

<p>Raphael frowned. All the animals, with the exception
of the eagles, had left him.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Raphael,’ continued the Sorcerer,
‘you must realize that the animals are not fit to
run things. In the first place, most of them live
by eating one another. And in the second place,
not one of them is unselfish enough to help another
species for the general good. Where are
your allies now?’ The eagles stirred angrily.
‘You have won this fight and I have lost. If
you destroy me, who will take my place in the
world?’</p>

<p>‘And,’ countered Raphael, ‘if I let you live,
what will become of the forests and the fields and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the rivers and the ocean and all the peoples who
live in them? You will build machines to kill them
all and man as well.’</p>

<p>‘Kill him!’ screamed the eagles.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it would be better,’ said Raphael, ‘if
Cassandra and I took you apart.’</p>

<p>‘You have Cassandra and you have destroyed
my city,’ said the Sorcerer calmly, ‘isn’t that
enough? I promise never to harm you.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t trust you,’ replied Raphael. ‘A machine
doesn’t keep its promises. You might build
another city.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ agreed the Sorcerer amiably. ‘But,
Raphael, consider. If you destroy me, man might
invent a more terrible machine, greater even than
I.’ The Sorcerer paused. ‘And then, Raphael, do
you realize what I do for you and your people?
I harness the wind and make electricity to light
your houses and run your mills. I build machines
that cook food and weave cloth. I do this and
much more.</p>

<p>‘I build boats to cross the ocean and bring
food from all the corners of the earth so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
your people do not die of hunger in the cities. I
make telegraphs and telephones and engines of
all sorts. I build aeroplanes and automobiles. I
print books and build theaters and photograph
moving pictures, and make all kinds of toys. Can
your animals X-ray you when you are sick and
broken? Without me you would live by killing
and in fear of being killed, eating roots and raw
flesh in the jungle.’</p>

<p>As the Sorcerer talked, a black cloud rose behind
the mountain that frowned over the fallen
city, rain began to fall gently, and a rainbow
arched across the sky. Was it a sign from Gæa?</p>

<p>Raphael stood a long time in thought, so long
that Cassandra stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>‘If,’ said the boy at last, ‘you will give me
your word not to build another city of mechanicos,
and if you will not kill the animals or injure my
people, I will let you live.’</p>

<p>When the eagles heard this, they screamed
angrily, and rising, disappeared into the black
cloud which had formed overhead in the shape
of a woman. Only Empyrean, Chief of All the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Eagles in the Sky, remained. He stood silent
with bowed head.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said the Sorcerer, ‘in that case there
is no further need for talk. I accept your terms.
Good-bye, Cassandra.’ And without another
word or glance the Sorcerer turned and walked
away.</p>

<p>Raphael and Cassandra said nothing, but stood
hand in hand and watched his great figure until it
was lost among the ruins. The boy was relieved
to see him go, but felt downcast and depressed.
Why, he did not know.</p>

<p>‘It is time I took you all home,’ said Empyrean
from behind them. The children jumped.</p>

<p>‘Where are the others?’ asked Raphael, who
noticed for the first time that the eagles had
gone.</p>

<p>‘The war is over, and they have flown away,’
answered the eagle sadly. ‘What more could
they do?’</p>

<p>An almost overwhelming wave of affection for
Empyrean surged over Raphael. The war was
over, Cassie had been saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>‘Hurry,’ said Empyrean. ‘Both of you climb
on my back. It will be night soon.’</p>

<p>Raphael looked up. The sun was setting, angry
and red over the mountains in the west, and night
was closing in.</p>

<p>‘Come on,’ said Raphael to his sister, and
helped her to scramble onto the eagle’s back.</p>

<p>When they were seated between the great
wings, night was already on them, and stars appeared
in the curtain of the sky. The eagle leapt
into the air, and soon they were flying rapidly
through the darkness.</p>

<p>I never knew night to come so fast, thought
Raphael. Moving through the night air made him
yawn. He felt very sleepy. No one spoke. There
was only the vague feeling of moving through
space.</p>

<p>Raphael scarcely remembered when the sun
rose pale in the east. The eagle set his wings
and coasted down through the air. In a few moments
it was quite bright and Raphael blinked
with the intensity of light. He realized with a
start that they were home again. Below the porch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
on which they lit was the apple orchard, and to
the west lay the barn.</p>

<p>The two children crawled through the window
into the nursery. Cassandra was still very sleepy
and stumbled over to her bed which lay white
and inviting with the covers turned back. Raphael
tucked her in, kissed her, and then turned
to thank Empyrean, their friend. But Chief of
All the Eagles in the Sky had gone.</p>

<p>Raphael, bewildered, rubbed his eyes. There
was Aunt Mary. She would be waiting anxiously.
He turned and rushed down the corridor to tell
her that he was back and that he had brought
Cassandra with him.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Mary! Aunt Mary!’ He burst into her
room. ‘I’ve brought Cassie home.’ He felt very
proud and excited.</p>

<p>‘What!’ said Aunt Mary sharply, rising to
the surface of the bedclothes like an angry
seal.</p>

<p>‘I’ve brought Cassie back,’ shouted Raphael.
‘I’ve defeated the Sorcerer. I’ve destroyed his
whole city.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Was he not wearing the white pajamas the
Sorcerer had forced upon him?</p>

<p>‘Raphael,’ said his Aunt, ‘you are talking absolute
nonsense. Go right back to bed. Don’t
you realize it’s only six o’clock?’</p>
